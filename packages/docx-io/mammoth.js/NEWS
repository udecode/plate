# 1.12.0

* Handle hyperlinked wp:anchor and wp:inline elements.

# 1.11.0

* Ignore style definitions using a style ID that has already been used.

* Disable external file accesses by default. External file access can be enabled
  using the externalFileAccess option.

* Handle numbering levels defined without an index.

# 1.10.0

* Add "Heading" and "Body" styles, as found in documents created by Apple Pages,
  to the default style map.

* Handle structured document tags representing checkboxes wrapped in other
  elements, such as table cells. Previously, the wrapping elements would have
  been ignored.

* Ignore deleted table rows.

* Add notes on security.

* Revert the change to explicitly use commonjs modules. This appeared to cause
  issues with some bundlers such as webpack when using mammoth.browser.js.

# 1.9.1

* Ignore AlternateContent elements when there is no Fallback element.

* Explicitly use commonjs modules. Since the modules should have previously been
  implicitly treated as commonjs modules, this shouldn't affect behaviour.

# 1.9.0

* Update lop to 0.4.2, which removes the use of the util module when there are
  errors during parsing. This should remove the need to polyfill util in the
  browser.

* Detect checkboxes, both as complex fields and structured document tags, and
  convert them to checkbox inputs.

# 1.8.0

* Add style mapping for highlights.

# 1.7.2

  numbering in paragraph styles so that the numbering properties in paragraph
  properties takes precedence.

* Add support for the strict document format.

# 1.6.0

  to polyfill stream in the browser.

* Adjust the internal implementation to remove the use of Buffer on the critical
  path, and provide APIs to read images and documents with embedded style maps
  without using Buffer. This should remove the need to polyfill Buffer in the
  browser. Since TextDecoder is now used, the minimum version of node.js is now
  v12.

* Remove the use of the util module. This should remove the need to polyfill
  util in the browser.

# 1.5.1

* Fix: npm 7 changed the behaviour of prepublish, causing the browser build not
  to be updated before publishing to npm. We now use prepare instead of
  prepublish, which has the same behaviour that prepublish previously had.

# 1.5.0

* Only use the alt text of image elements as a fallback. If an alt attribute is
  returned from the function passed to mammoth.images.imgElement, that value
  will now be preferred to the alt text of the image element.

# 1.4.21

* Ignore w:u elements when w:val is missing.

# 1.4.20

* Emit warning instead of throwing exception when image file cannot be found for
  a:blip elements.

  containing multiple paragraphs to be converted into a single paragraph.

# 1.4.5

* When using the pretty HTML writer, don't format HTML inside pre elements.

* Read the children of v:rect elements.

# 1.3.4

* Read children of w:object elements.

# 1.3.3

* Handle hyperlinks created with complex fields.

# 1.3.2

  images within a document couldn't be found.

# 1.3.1

* Add getDescendants() and getDescendantsOfType() to transforms module.

* Add font property to runs.

# 1.3.0

      r[style-name^='Code '] => code

  false or 0.

# 1.2.4

# 1.2.1

* Use alt text title as alt text for images when the alt text description is
  missing entirely.

# 1.2.0

* Add support for table cells spanning multiple columns.

# 1.0.0

* Generated IDs no longer insert a hyphen after the ID prefix.

* The default ID prefix is now the empty string rather than a random number
  followed by a hyphen.

* Rename mammoth.images.inline to mammoth.images.imgElement to better reflect
  its behaviour.

# 0.3.33

* Improve collapsing of elements when there are empty elements.

* Allow bold and italic style mappings to be configured.

# 0.3.31

# 0.3.30

* Improve support for lists made in LibreOffice. Specifically, this changes the
  default style mapping for paragraphs with a style of "Normal" to have the
  lowest precedence.

* Replace nomnom with argparse for CLI argument parsing. Usage should be the
  same, but unknown arguments will now cause an exit with failure rather than
  being ignored.

* Always use mc:Fallback when reading mc:AlternateContent elements.

# 0.3.28

* Avoid inserting newlines around inline elements when pretty-printing HTML.

# 0.3.22

* Add support for underlines in style map.

  a separate paragraph that appears after the paragraph containing the text box.

# 0.3.20

* Support styles defined without a name

# 0.3.19

* Add ignoreEmptyParagraphs option, which defaults to true.

# 0.3.18

* Make style names case-insensitive in style mappings. This should make style
  mappings easier to write, especially since Microsoft Word sometimes represents
  style names in the UI differently from in the style definition. For instance,
  the style displayed in Word as "Heading 1" has  a style name of "heading 1".
  This hopefully shouldn't cause an issue for anyone, but if you were relying
  on case-sensitivity, please do get in touch.

  the terminology used internally in docx files. Any document transforms that
  get or set the `styleName` property should use the `styleId` property instead.

  a paragraph with the style name `Heading 1`:

    p[style-name='Heading 1']
