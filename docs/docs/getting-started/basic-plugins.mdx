:::note
Even when not providing any `plugins` to `Plate`, core plugins like `react`, `history` are loaded by default. To disable these, use [disableCorePlugins](/docs/Plate#disablecoreplugins) prop.
:::

This guide will show you how to use the existing Plate plugins.


### Plugins

Let's use the basic element and basic mark plugins.

:::note
`Plate` is using the `type` property so a plugin can render a node by type.
:::


import { BasicPluginsComponentsSandpack, BasicPluginsDefaultSandpack } from "./BasicPluginsSandpack";

<BasicPluginsDefaultSandpack />

Everything actually works by looking at the debug value. However, we didn't provide any `components` to render, so it's using the default (unstyled) ones.
The default element component is a `div` and the default leaf component is a `span`.

:::info
Plate plugins are bundled without any default component,
meaning that you're in full control over markup and styling
so you can plug-in your own design system or Plate UI (see next section).
:::

### Components

To plug all the components at once, you can use `createPlugins`:
- use the first parameter for the `plugins` 
- use the second parameter for the `components`. In the following example we'll use `createPlateUI()`, which returns all Plate components by plugin key.



<BasicPluginsComponentsSandpack />

Voil√†!

`Plate` enforces decoupled structures, you can read the next sections to learn more about the API.
