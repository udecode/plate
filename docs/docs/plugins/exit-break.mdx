title: Exit Break

The Exit Break plugin streamlines the workflow when working with large blocks of text
by enabling users to quickly navigate to the end of a block and start a new one with a single keystroke.

This feature is particularly beneficial for writers, bloggers, or anyone who frequently works with substantial amounts of text.

### Demo

To use the Exit Break feature, press the cmd+enter (Mac) or ctrl+enter (Windows) keyboard shortcut to move to the end of a text block and begin a new one.

You can see this in action by testing it out in the demo we've provided.










import { ExitBreakSandpack } from "./ExitBreakSandpack";

<ExitBreakSandpack />
