Plate Cloud is the official Plate plugin and cloud service for image and attachment uploads, automatic server-side image resizing, and future Plate cloud services.

It supports:

- Drag and drop uploading of images and attachments
- Paste uploading of images and attachments
- Using a file picker for uploading images and attachment
- Drag resize of images with server-side image resizing which optimizes download speed
- Automatically delivers high DPI images to high DPI devices and normal sized images to everyone else

Your usage of Plate Cloud supports the development of Plate.

You can start by [getting a free Portive API key](https://admin.portive.com/).
