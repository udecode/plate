The **`@udecode/plate-serializer-html`** plugin provides functionality to convert Slate value to HTML without requiring an editor instance.

This feature is particularly useful for server-side rendering, as it does not require a complicated setup.

### Demo


import { SerializingHtmlSandpack } from "./SerializingHtmlSandpack";

<SerializingHtmlSandpack />


### Installation

Follow these steps to serialize Slate value into HTML:

1. Install the required packages:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @udecode/plate
# or
npm install @udecode/plate-serializer-html
```

2. Import `serializeHtml` and pass the `editor` instance and its children as arguments:

```tsx
import { serializeHtml } from '@udecode/plate';

const html = serializeHtml(editor, {
  nodes: editor.children,
});
```

Note that the **`createDeserializeHTMLPlugin`** is installed by `Plate` by default so you don't need to do it.
