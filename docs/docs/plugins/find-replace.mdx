:::note
"Replace" feature is not yet supported
:::

The Find and Replace plugin enhances your editor by enabling users to easily locate and substitute text within the content.

The feature can search for whole words, word parts, or phrases, and match the case of the searched text.

This is particularly useful in long documents or those that use specific words in various contexts.

With the ability to replace individual instances or all occurrences of the searched phrase, this plugin streamlines the editing process and ensures content consistency.

### Demo

To utilize the Find and Replace feature, you can click the toolbar button or use the **`Ctrl/Cmd+F`** keyboard shortcut.

This will bring up the search panel, allowing you to find and replace desired words or phrases.

For example, try replacing "steam" with "diesel" in the demo content, making sure to match the case as there are different instances of the word present in the document.










import { FindReplaceSandpack } from "./FindReplaceSandpack";

<FindReplaceSandpack />
