The list indentation feature allows you to set list indentation for blocks such as paragraphs or headings.

The "indent list" plugin differs from the ["list" plugin](/docs/plugins/list):
- the list plugin has a nested structure ("list" block having "list item" block children) whereas 
the indent list plugin has a flat structure, resulting into different queries and transforms
- any block can be indented as a list
- the rendered block tags stay the same (e.g. `div`) instead of using `ul`/`ol`
- the indent list plugin has more freedom by default but anyone can extend it to reproduce the list plugin rules. 
The list plugin has strict rules between parent and children
