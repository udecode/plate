The Indent plugin enables you to customize the indentation of text blocks, such as paragraphs, headings, and lists.

It is designed to visually distinguish different parts of the content, which is particularly useful for differentiating structural elements like headings or lists.

Additionally, it can be employed to present quotes or emphasize paragraphs or passages that need to be set apart from the main body of content.

### Demo

Use the indent or outdent toolbar buttons in the editor below to control the level of indentation of the content, both for paragraph text and headers.








import { IndentSandpack } from "./IndentSandpack";

<IndentSandpack />


### Installation

Follow these steps to integrate the indent plugin into your Plate editor:

1. Install the required packages:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @udecode/plate
# or
npm install @udecode/plate-indent
```

2. Import the plugin and include it in your plugin list:

```
import { createIndentPlugin } from '@udecode/plate-indent';
import { basicNodesPlugins } from '@udecode/plate-basic-nodes';

const plugins = createPlugins([
  ...otherPlugins,
  ...basicNodesPlugins,
  createIndentPlugin(),
], {
  components: plateUI,
});

```



### Options

#### `offset` and `unit`

- By default, the block indentation plugin increases or decreases the current indentation by the given `offset`, using the given `unit`.
- The above demo is using the default configuration, which defines a `24px` indentation step.
- Default is `24`

#### `indentMax`

- You generally want to set a maximum number of indentation so the text stays readable.
- Using `indentMax: 5` will limit the indent to 5 levels.
- Default is `'px'`

### Commands

#### `indent`

- Increase the indentation of the selected blocks.

#### `outdent`

- Decrease the indentation of the selected blocks
