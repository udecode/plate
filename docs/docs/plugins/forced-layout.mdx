The Forced Layout plugin empowers users to maintain a consistent document structure by enforcing specific element usage.

For instance, the first line could be mandated as an H1 element.

This feature promotes uniformity and organization within the created content.

### Demo

When using the Forced Layout plugin, the editor will automatically ensure that the specified elements are used as required,
maintaining the desired structure throughout the document.

Allows you to enforce document structure. For example, you can require that the first line is an H1.









import { ForcedLayoutSandpack } from "./ForcedLayoutSandpack";

<ForcedLayoutSandpack />


### Installation

Follow these steps to integrate the forced layout plugin into your Plate editor:


1. Install the required packages:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @udecode/plate
# or
npm install @udecode/plate-normalizers
npm install @udecode/plate-trailing-block
```

2. Import the plugin and add it to your plugin list:

```
const plugins = createMyPlugins(
  [
    ...basicNodesPlugins,
    createTrailingBlockPlugin(trailingBlockPlugin),
    createNormalizeTypesPlugin({
      options: {
        rules: [{ path: [0], strictType: ELEMENT_H1 }],
      },
    }),
  ],
  {
    components: plateUI,
  }
);

```



### Options

```tsx
export interface TrailingBlockPlugin extends QueryNodeOptions {
  /**
   * Level where the trailing node should be, the first level being 0.
   */
  level?: number;

  /**
   * Type of the trailing block
   */
  type?: string;
}
```

```tsx
interface Rule {
  /**
   * Force the type of the node at the given path
   */
  strictType?: string;
  /**
   * Type of the inserted node at the given path if `strictType` is not provided
   */
  type?: string;
  /**
   * Path where the rule applies
   */
  path: Path;
}

export interface NormalizeTypesPlugin extends ErrorHandler {
  /**
   * Set of rules for the types.
   * For each rule, provide a `path` and either `strictType` or `type`.
   * If there is no node existing at `path`:
   * insert a node with `strictType`.
   * If there is a node existing at `path` but its type is not `strictType` or `type`:
   * set the node type to `strictType` or `type`.
   */
  rules?: Rule[];
}
```
