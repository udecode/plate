Plugins are objects passed to the [plugins](Plate#plugins) prop of `Plate`.

## Plugin Factory

A plugin factory is a function where...

- the naming convention is `create...Plugin`
- the return type is a [PlatePlugin](https://plate-api.udecode.io/interfaces/plateplugin.html) object.
- the first parameter should be an (optional) object for options.

Let's create a few plugins to cover the plugin properties.

### Element Plugin

A plugin to add an element: a paragraph as a block controlled by slate:

```ts
export const createParagraphPlugin = createPluginFactory({
  key: ELEMENT_PARAGRAPH,
  isElement: true,
  deserializeHtml: getParagraphDeserialize(),
  onKeyDown: onKeyDownToggleElement,
})
```

- [key](#key)
  - set the plugin key.
- [deserialize](#deserialize)
  - to enable HTML deserialization, set a deserializer.
- [isElement](#iselement)
  - to enable element rendering, set true.
- [onKeyDown](#onkeydown)
  - to enable block toggling with a hotkey, use `onKeyDownToggleElement`

### Inline & Void Element Plugin

A plugin to add an inline and void element: a tag uncontrolled by slate:

```ts
export const createTagPlugin = createPluginFactory({
  key: ELEMENT_TAG,
  isElement: true,
  isInline: true,
  isVoid: true,
  deserializeHtml: getTagDeserialize(),
})
```

- [isInline](#isinline)
  - set true if the element is inline.
- [isVoid](#isvoid)
  - set true if the element is void.

### Leaf Plugin

Finally, a plugin to add a leaf: a highlight mark.

```ts
export const createHighlightPlugin = createPluginFactory({
  key: MARK_HIGHLIGHT,
  isLeaf: true,
  deserializeHtml: getHighlightDeserialize(),
  handlers: {
    onKeyDown: onKeyDownToggleMark,
  },
})
```

- [isLeaf](#isleaf)
  - to enable leaf rendering, set true.
- [onKeyDown](#onkeydown)
  - to enable mark toggling with a hotkey, use `onKeyDownToggleMark`

### Overrider Plugin

Finally, a plugin to add an editor method overrider:

```ts
export const createReactPlugin = {
  withOverrides: withReact
};
```

## `PlatePlugin`

### `decorate`

- Function used to decorate ranges.
- If the function returns undefined then no ranges are modified.
- If the function returns an array the returned ranges are merged with the ranges called by other plugins.
- See https://docs.slatejs.org/concepts/09-rendering#decorations

### `deserialize`

- HTML Deserializer for element and leaf.

### `isInline`

- Whether the element is inline.

### `isVoid`

- Whether the element is void.

### `inject.props`

- Overrides rendered node props (shallow merge).
- This enables controlling the props of any node component (use cases: indent, align,...).

### `key`

- Plugin key in the `plugins` set.

### `renderElement`

- Function used to render an element.
- If the function returns `undefined` then the next `RenderElement` function is called.
- If the function renders a JSX element then that JSX element is rendered.
- See https://docs.slatejs.org/concepts/09-rendering

### `renderLeaf`

- Function used to render the children of a leaf.
- If the function returns `undefined` then the next `RenderLeaf` function is called and the current children are not modified.
- The children passed to the function may be the result of a previous plugin.
- To wrap the previous plugin simply return the passed children.
- You do not need to add the attributes to your return value.
- The attributes are added by default.
- `RenderLeaf` always returns a JSX element (even if unmodified) to support multiple marks on a node.
- See https://docs.slatejs.org/concepts/09-rendering#leaves

### `serialize`

- HTML Serializer for element and leaf.

### `withOverrides`

- Editor method overriders.
- See https://docs.slatejs.org/concepts/08-plugins

### Handlers

- Function called whenever the corresponding event occurs in the editor.
- There is 3 places where a handler (e.g. `onClick`) can be defined (called in this order):
  - in `PlatePlugin` (plugin) 
  - in `Plate` (props)
  - in `Slate` (internal handler)
- Event handlers can return a boolean flag to specify whether the event can be treated as being handled.
- If the event is handled, the next handlers will not be called.

```tsx
const onClick = (event) => {
  // Implement custom event logic...

  // When no value is returned, the next handlers will be executed when
  // isPropagationStopped was not set on the event
};

const onDrop = (event) => {
  // Implement custom event logic...

  // No matter the state of the event, treat it as being handled by returning
  // true here, the next handlers will be skipped
  return true;
};

const onDragStart = (event) => {
  // Implement custom event logic...

  // No matter the status of the event, treat event as *not* being handled by
  // returning false, the next handlers will be executed afterward
  return false;
};
```

`Plate` extends the following handlers:

```tsx
type ReturnType = boolean | void;
