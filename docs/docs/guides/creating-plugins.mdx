Plate are objects passed to the [plugins](Plate#plugins) prop of `Plate`.

## Plugin Factory

A plugin factory is a function where...

- the naming convention is `create...Plugin`
- the return type is a [PlatePlugin](https://plate-api.udecode.io/interfaces/plateplugin.html) object.
- the first parameter should be an (optional) object for options.

Let's create a few plugins to cover the plugin properties.

### Element Plugin

A plugin to add an element: a paragraph as a block controlled by slate:

```ts
export const createParagraphPlugin = (): PlatePlugin => ({
  deserialize: getParagraphDeserialize(),
  onKeyDown: getToggleElementOnKeyDown(ELEMENT_PARAGRAPH),
  pluginKeys: ELEMENT_PARAGRAPH,
  renderElement: getRenderElement(ELEMENT_PARAGRAPH),
});
```

- [deserialize](#deserialize)
  - to enable HTML deserialization, set a deserializer.
- [renderElement](#renderelement)
  - to enable element rendering, use [getRenderElement](https://plate-api.udecode.io/globals.html#getrenderelement)
- [onKeyDown](#onkeydown)
  - to enable block toggling with a hotkey, use `getToggleElementOnKeyDown`
- [pluginKeys](#pluginkeys)
  - set the paragraph key.

### Inline & Void Element Plugin

A plugin to add an inline and void element: a tag uncontrolled by slate:

```ts
export const createTagPlugin = (): PlatePlugin => ({
  deserialize: getTagDeserialize(),
  renderElement: getRenderElement(ELEMENT_TAG),
  inlineTypes: getPlatePluginTypes(ELEMENT_TAG),
  voidTypes: getPlatePluginTypes(ELEMENT_TAG),
});
```

- [inlineTypes](#inlinetypes)
  - set the tag key to make it inline.
- [voidTypes](#voidtypes)
  - set the tag key to make it void.

### Leaf Plugin

Finally, a plugin to add a leaf: a highlight mark.

```ts
export const createHighlightPlugin = (): PlatePlugin => ({
  pluginKeys: MARK_HIGHLIGHT,
  renderLeaf: getRenderLeaf(MARK_HIGHLIGHT),
  deserialize: getHighlightDeserialize(),
  onKeyDown: getToggleMarkOnKeyDown(MARK_HIGHLIGHT),
});
```

- [renderLeaf](#renderleaf)
  - to enable leaf rendering, use [getRenderLeaf](https://plate-api.udecode.io/globals.html#getrenderleaf)
- [onKeyDown](#onkeydown)
  - to enable mark toggling with a hotkey, use `getToggleMarkOnKeyDown`

### Overrider Plugin

Finally, a plugin to add an editor method overrider:

```ts
export const createReactPlugin = {
  withOverrides: withReact
};
```

## `PlatePlugin`

### `decorate`

- Function used to decorate ranges.
- If the function returns undefined then no ranges are modified.
- If the function returns an array the returned ranges are merged with the ranges called by other plugins.
- See https://docs.slatejs.org/concepts/09-rendering#decorations

### `deserialize`

- HTML Deserializer for element and leaf.

### `inlineTypes`

- Inline element types

### `overrideProps`

- Overrides rendered node props (shallow merge).
- This enables controlling the props of any node component (use cases: indent, align,...).

### `pluginKeys`

- Plugin keys to support configuration.

### `renderElement`

- Function used to render an element.
- If the function returns `undefined` then the next `RenderElement` function is called.
- If the function renders a JSX element then that JSX element is rendered.
- See https://docs.slatejs.org/concepts/09-rendering

### `renderLeaf`

- Function used to render the children of a leaf.
- If the function returns `undefined` then the next `RenderLeaf` function is called and the current children are not modified.
- The children passed to the function may be the result of a previous plugin.
- To wrap the previous plugin simply return the passed children.
- You do not need to add the attributes to your return value.
- The attributes are added by default.
- `RenderLeaf` always returns a JSX element (even if unmodified) to support multiple marks on a node.
- See https://docs.slatejs.org/concepts/09-rendering#leaves

### `serialize`

- HTML Serializer for element and leaf.

### `voidTypes`

- Void element types.

### `withOverrides`

- Editor method overriders.
- See https://docs.slatejs.org/concepts/08-plugins

### Handlers

- Function called whenever the corresponding event occurs in the editor.
- There is 3 places where a handler (e.g. `onClick`) can be defined (called in this order):
  - in `PlatePlugin` (plugin) 
  - in `Plate` (props)
  - in `Slate` (internal handler)
- Event handlers can return a boolean flag to specify whether the event can be treated as being handled.
- If the event is handled, the next handlers will not be called.

```tsx
const onClick = (event) => {
  // Implement custom event logic...

  // When no value is returned, the next handlers will be executed when
  // isPropagationStopped was not set on the event
};

const onDrop = (event) => {
  // Implement custom event logic...

  // No matter the state of the event, treat it as being handled by returning
  // true here, the next handlers will be skipped
  return true;
};

const onDragStart = (event) => {
  // Implement custom event logic...

  // No matter the status of the event, treat event as *not* being handled by
  // returning false, the next handlers will be executed afterward
  return false;
};
```

`Plate` extends the following handlers:

```tsx
type ReturnType = boolean | void;
