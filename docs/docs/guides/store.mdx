`Plate` is using a [zustood](https://github.com/udecode/zustood) store for each editor, stored by **id**.

If rendering only one editor, the store `id` is optional, the default being `'main'`.

# Plate Store

Plate Store is a zustood store that implements the following [state](#state):

## State

### [`decorate`](/docs/plate#editable-decorate)
### [`editableProps`](/docs/plate#editable-editableprops)
### [`editor`](/docs/plate#editor)
### [`enabled`](/docs/plate#enabled)

### `isRendered`

- Whether `Editable` is rendered so slate DOM is resolvable.

### `keyEditor`

- A key that is incremented on each editor change.

### `keyPlugins`

- A key that is incremented on each editor.plugins change.

### `keySelection`

- A key that is incremented on each editor.selection change.

### [`onChange`](/docs/plate#slate-onchange)
### [`plugins`](/docs/plate#plugins)
### [`renderElement`](/docs/plate#editable-renderelement)
### [`renderLeaf`](/docs/plate#editable-renderleaf)
### [`value`](/docs/plate#value)

## Hook Selectors

- Use `usePlateSelectors(id).<state property>()` when you need to subscribe to a value.
- Example: `usePlateSelectors(id).value()` will subscribe to `value` changes.
- See [zustood hooks](https://github.com/udecode/zustood#hooks) 

## Getters

- Use `getPlateSelectors(id).<state property>()` when you don't need to subscribe to a value.
- Example `getPlateSelectors(id).value()` will get `value`. 
- See [zustood getters](https://github.com/udecode/zustood#getters)

## Actions

- `Plate` subscribes to the store state so you can update the store state in a flexible way.
- Use `getPlateActions(id).<state property>(<new value>)` when you need to update the value of a store property.
- Example: `getPlateActions(id).value(<new value>)` will update `value`.
- See [zustood actions](https://github.com/udecode/zustood#actions) 

## Provider

### `PlateProvider`

You can't access the store before it's initialized. Two ways of doing this:
- Inside `Plate` component: the store is initialized, you can access it.
- Outside `Plate` component (e.g. for a shared toolbar): the store is not initialized, you will need to render `PlateProvider` above your accessing component. 

The only prop of `PlateProvider` is `id` which is the id of the store (defaults to `'main'`).

### `withPlateProvider`

- HOC that wraps your component with `PlateProvider`.
- Usage: `withPlateProvider(<Component>, id)`

# Plates Store

This store is an object whose property keys are [editor ids](Plate#id) and whose property values are zustood stores (it's a "store of stores"), where the state implements [PlateState](#state).

In other words, `platesStore` is a store that can store many plate stores by id, looking to this:

```bash
<zustood store>({
  'main': <zustood store>({
    id: 'main',
    editor: ...,
  }),
  'other': <zustood store>({
    id: 'other',
    editor: ...,
  }),
  ...
})
```

`Plate` is taking care of the store initialization and updates. You will not need to use this store directly.


# Event Editor Store

This store is an object whose property keys are event names (e.g. `'focus'`) and whose property values are [editor ids](Plate#id).
This is useful when having [multiple editors](multiple-editors) and get one based on DOM events (e.g. the last focused editor).

One of the core plugins of [Plate](Plate) will store the following events.

## State

### `focus`

- the last focused editor id

### `blur`

- the last blurred editor id (sets `focus` to `null`)

### `last`

- the last defined editor id

## Hooks

### `useEventEditorSelectors`

- Hook selectors
- Example: `useEventEditorSelectors().focus()` will get the last focused editor id.
- See [zustood hooks](https://github.com/udecode/zustood#hooks) 

### `useEventEditorId`

- Get last event editor id: focus, blur or last.

### `useEventPlateId`

- Get the context plate id if called in a `PlateProvider`
- If the latter is not defined, [useEventEditorId](#useeventeditorid) will be used.

## HOC

### `PlateEventProvider`

- `PlateProvider` where `id` is `useEventPlateId`

### `withPlateEventProvider`

- HOC that will add `PlateEventProvider` above a component.
- Useful for toolbars shared between multiple editors.
