title: Drag & Drop
---

The Drag and Drop component allows for easy movement of text and block objects, such as images or tables, within the editor.
It also enables the ability to drop HTML and plain text from external sources into the editor.
This feature improves the user experience by making it simple to move and insert content within the editor.


### Demo

The Drag and Drop component allows you to select a block with the handle located on its left side and move it to a different location within the editor.
You can also select text and move it to a different location. Try it out for yourself to see how it can improve your editing workflow.

- Wrap your editor with `<DndProvider backend={HTML5Backend}>` provider
- Override your components with `components = withStyledDraggables(components)`, these will wrap your block components with a draggable handle.
- Use `createNodeIdPlugin()` plugin as it requires `id` property on your blocks.











import { DndSandpack } from "./DndSandpack";

<DndSandpack />
