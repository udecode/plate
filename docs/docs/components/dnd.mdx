### Usage

- Wrap your editor with `<DndProvider backend={HTML5Backend}>` provider
- Override your components with `components = withStyledDraggables(components)`, these will wrap your block components with a draggable handle.
- Use `createNodeIdPlugin()` plugin as it requires `id` property on your blocks.
