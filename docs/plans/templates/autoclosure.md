Objective:
TODO: State the already-started work and exact clean/ship threshold.

Goal plan:
{{PLAN_PATH}}

Template:
{{TEMPLATE_PATH}}

Completion threshold:
- TODO: Define the complete closeout matrix.
- No new product scope. Completion requires every applicable lane below to have
  fresh evidence, `pnpm check` passing, review findings closed, authorized
  GitHub delivery complete, and the goal checker passing.

Verification surface:
- TODO: Name targeted proof, generation, reviews, `pnpm check`, and PR read-back.

Constraints:
- Finish the intended delta; do not invent the next feature.
- Preserve source/generated/package/docs ownership.
- Use a different diagnostic after repeated failure signatures.

Boundaries:
- intended delta: pending
- allowed repairs: pending
- unrelated files: preserve; do not treat as blockers
- non-goals: pending

Output budget strategy:
- TODO: Scope closeout audits and cap noisy commands.

Blocked condition:
- TODO: Name missing authority, external action, or proven environment blocker.

Work Checklist:
- [ ] Every PR has its own `task` invocation and dedicated task plan; a batch
      plan or aggregate autoclosure is not used as a substitute.
- [ ] Existing-PR and no-PR entry paths were distinguished before source
      review. A no-PR local slice has a dedicated current `task` plan and defers
      feedback/merge until delivery creates the exact PR, records it in the
      plan at head, and passes the task compliance gate.
- [ ] Task evidence was verified from the PR body, fetched head, and exact PR
      ownership; otherwise the required comment and `CLOSED` state were read
      back and no source review, repair, merge, or release work continued.
- [ ] Intended behavior and exclusions are reconstructed from real sources.
- [ ] Each lane is proven or N/A with a concrete reason.
- [ ] Generated output was changed through its owner and regenerated.
- [ ] Package/docs/registry/template/browser/changeset contracts are synchronized.
- [ ] Full `resolve-pr-feedback` ran for the exact compliant PR; every
      actionable P1-or-higher finding was fixed, proved, replied to, and
      resolved or received the required top-level reply receipt.
- [ ] For a compliant PR, local committed `HEAD`, fetched PR ref, and live
      `headRefOid` matched before proof/reply/resolution and after every push.
      For a noncompliant PR, this and all feedback gates are N/A with the
      required remediation-comment and `CLOSED` receipts.
- [ ] Unfiltered top-level PR comments and review bodies were fetched through
      the GitHub API, compared by ID/URL with helper output, and every excluded
      bot/author item was ledgered; identity alone never dismissed feedback.
      Only the exact terminal receipt produced/read back by this run is exempt
      from the versioned ledger.
- [ ] All inline review threads were fetched with GraphQL cursor pagination
      without filtering resolved/outdated items; every thread has priority,
      rationale, relocation, and proof state in the ledger.
- [ ] Every actionable feedback item has a persisted P0-P3 priority and
      one-sentence rationale from the autoclosure rubric; ambiguous P1-versus-
      lower items fail closed as P1.
- [ ] Every P1-or-higher proof reran after the final material branch push,
      regardless of file type, including resolved or outdated threads that
      disappear from the helper's unresolved-thread output.
- [ ] Feedback was re-fetched after the last push/reply/resolution and shows
      zero unresolved actionable P1-or-higher findings.
- [ ] After all versioned plan/source updates were pushed, the exact-head P1
      proof/read-back receipt was posted to the PR and read back; no terminal
      receipt-only branch push was created. A post-comment `headRefOid` fetch
      matches the OID recorded in that receipt, and a post-comment helper/raw
      feedback fetch still shows zero actionable P1-or-higher items and no new
      URL lacking a verdict or explicit deferral, except the verified receipt.
- [ ] Any remaining P2-or-lower item has its exact URL plus the user's explicit
      priority deferral recorded; no feedback was silently ignored.
- [ ] Accepted cleanup and review findings are closed.
- [ ] PR body and check state match the final evidence.
- [ ] Residual blocker/waiver has exact evidence and next owner.
