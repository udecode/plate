# browser pack

Use this pack when the changed behavior has a real browser, route, UI, visual,
selection, interaction, console, or network surface.

Start Gates:
| Gate | Applies | Evidence |
|------|---------|----------|
| Browser pack selected | pending | pending |
| Browser route / app surface identified | pending | pending |
| Browser tool decision recorded | pending | pending |
| Console/network caveat policy recorded | pending | pending |

Work Checklist:
- [ ] Browser pack: route, interaction path, and expected visible outcome are recorded before proof.
- [ ] Browser pack: Browser proof is used for normal app surfaces; Chrome proof
      is used directly for native downloads, print/print-preview, file
      picker/uploads, clipboard, dialogs/permissions, profile/extension state,
      or exact Chrome rendering; Computer Use is used when native Chrome/OS UI
      needs visual inspection and Chrome automation cannot read it.
- [ ] Browser pack: console and network errors are checked or explicitly out of scope.
- [ ] Browser pack: screenshot or visual waiver happens only after the
      applicable Browser->Chrome->Computer path cannot inspect the state.
