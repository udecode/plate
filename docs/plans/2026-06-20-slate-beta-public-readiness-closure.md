# Slate beta public readiness closure

Objective:
Close Slate beta public-readiness; done when stale PR is handled, beta docs/deploy/package/browser proof passes, and share copy is ready.

Goal plan:
docs/plans/2026-06-20-slate-beta-public-readiness-closure.md

Template:
docs/plans/templates/task.md

Primary template:
docs/plans/templates/task.md

Applied packs:
- docs (docs/plans/templates/packs/docs.md)
- browser (docs/plans/templates/packs/browser.md)
- package-api (docs/plans/templates/packs/package-api.md)

Task source:
- type: user-directed public readiness closure
- id / link: current thread, PR https://github.com/udecode/plate/pull/5037, local docs at http://localhost:3002/docs/slate
- title: Slate beta public-readiness closure
- acceptance criteria: close or otherwise resolve stale PR #5037; confirm pushed `next` deploy state; audit Slate beta docs as a skeptical external reader; run Slate/docs/browser proof gates; verify `@platejs/slate-*` package story; prepare concise Slack/share copy and caveat.

First checkpoint:
- Before implementation or broad exploration, copy every explicit prompt
  requirement into this plan as checkable checkpoints: scope, non-goals,
  timing/duration, stop conditions, deliverables, final handoff sections,
  verification surface, and success criteria.
- Do not continue into implementation until this extraction is complete or
  explicitly marked N/A with reason.

Timed checkpoint:
- requested duration: N/A: user did not provide a duration.
- semantics: N/A: normal one-shot closure.
- initial confidence score: 72/100: docs and local browser proof are recently green, but live deploy, stale PR closure, package story, and final share copy still need current proof.
- improvement loop: raise confidence by resolving PR #5037, checking live beta deploy, auditing current Slate docs/package wording, running focused commands, and recording residual beta risk.
- final score / loop closure: pending until closeout.

Completion threshold:
- Stale PR #5037 is closed or explicitly left open with evidence-backed reason.
- `beta.platejs.org` or the active next deployment is checked for the Slate docs route and reported honestly.
- Slate beta docs audit finds no stale install/package-path blockers or records exact remaining blockers.
- Required local gates pass or any failure is fixed/reported with owner: docs source check, Slate fast check, focused browser proof for `/docs/slate`, `/docs/slate/why-this-fork`, `/docs/slate/migration`, and `/examples/slate/richtext`.
- Package/public surface story for intended Slate beta packages is verified from current repo/package metadata and release artifacts.
- Slack/share copy and known beta caveat are ready.
- Task closure is legal only when the source-of-truth acceptance criteria are
  satisfied or explicitly narrowed, required verification evidence is recorded,
  code-review and release-artifact gates are closed when applicable, tracker/PR
  sync is complete or marked N/A with reason, and
  `node .agents/skills/autogoal/scripts/check-complete.mjs docs/plans/2026-06-20-slate-beta-public-readiness-closure.md` passes.

Verification surface:
- GitHub live state for PR #5037 through `gh pr view` and close mutation if still stale.
- Live deploy/network check for `https://beta.platejs.org/docs/slate` and key leaf routes, or exact deployment blocker.
- Source audit of `content/docs/slate/**`, `content/docs/meta.json`, `apps/www/next.config.ts`, `package.json`, `apps/www/package.json`, package manifests for Slate beta package names.
- Commands: `pnpm --filter www check:docs`; `pnpm check:slate:fast` if available; focused browser route proof with Browser or curl fallback when Browser is unavailable.
- Final mechanical gate: `node .agents/skills/autogoal/scripts/check-complete.mjs docs/plans/2026-06-20-slate-beta-public-readiness-closure.md`.

Constraints:
- Preserve existing user-facing behavior outside the task scope.
- Prefer the durable ownership boundary over caller-by-caller patches.
- Do not create PRs, comments, commits, or pushes unless the task/user/skill
  requires them. Closing PR #5037 is allowed because the user said `go` after
  the lane proposal that named closing stale PR #5037 first.
- Do not add broad ceremony when the task is trivial or docs-only.
- Do not restart broad Plate migration or package architecture work in this goal.
- Do not silently publish or release packages.

Boundaries:
- Source of truth: current `next` checkout, live GitHub PR #5037, `beta.platejs.org` / local `localhost:3002`, Slate docs/package metadata.
- Allowed edit scope: Slate docs, docs nav/redirects, release/readiness notes, narrow package/docs metadata fixes if audit finds blockers.
- Browser surface: `/docs/slate`, `/docs/slate/why-this-fork`, `/docs/slate/migration`, `/examples/slate/richtext`.
- Browser strategy: Use Browser for normal app QA; use curl only for deploy reachability or when Browser proof is unavailable. Use Chrome directly
  for native downloads, print/print-preview, file picker/uploads, clipboard,
  browser dialogs/permissions, extension/profile state, or exact Chrome
  rendering; use Computer Use only for native Chrome/OS UI that needs visual
  inspection after Chrome automation cannot read it.
- Tracker sync: PR #5037 close only; no issue comments unless a live blocker requires user approval.
- Non-goals: Plate runtime migration, npm publish, release promotion, broad package redesign, broad external issue ledgers.

Output budget strategy:
- Use focused `rg` patterns and package manifest reads; cap tool output; avoid streaming generated trees, `.next`, `apps/slate/out`, full Playwright traces, or broad docs dumps. Use counts/file lists before line dumps when auditing many docs.

Blocked condition:
- Block only if GitHub/Vercel/live network auth prevents current proof, package/deploy state cannot be inspected locally or live, or a failing required gate needs a public release/deployment credential outside this checkout.

Task state:
- task_type: public beta readiness closure
- task_complexity: normal
- current_phase: intake
- current_phase_status: in_progress
- next_phase: implementation
- goal_status: active

Current verdict:
- verdict: proceed
- confidence: 72/100
- next owner: autogoal executing docs/browser/package/maintainer closure
- reason: stale PR is confirmed superseded, docs were recently patched, but live deploy/package/browser closure still needs fresh proof.

Completion rule:
- Do not call `update_goal(status: complete)` while any required checklist item
  remains unchecked. If an item does not apply, check it and add `N/A: <reason>`.
- Do not call `update_goal(status: complete)` until every completion threshold
  above is satisfied, final handoff evidence is recorded, and
  `node .agents/skills/autogoal/scripts/check-complete.mjs docs/plans/2026-06-20-slate-beta-public-readiness-closure.md` passes.
- Do not create hook state for this goal. This file plus the active goal are the
  durable state.

Work Checklist:
- [ ] If a duration was requested, it is recorded as minimum active work unless
      explicitly marked hard stop; when no better metric exists, initial and
      final confidence scores are recorded.
- [ ] First checkpoint complete: every explicit prompt requirement, scope
      boundary, timing constraint, stop condition, deliverable, final handoff
      section, verification surface, and success criterion is copied into this
      plan as checkable checkpoints before implementation.
- [ ] Short objective plus outcome, completion threshold, verification surface,
      constraints, boundaries, and blocked condition are concrete.
- [ ] Task source classified with source type, id/link, title, task type,
      acceptance criteria, caveats, likely files/routes/packages, browser
      surface, and root-cause layer.
- [ ] Required video or screen-recording evidence is cached/read as normalized
      `<video-transcripts>` XML, or marked N/A with reason.
- [ ] Nearby repo instructions and implementation patterns read before edits.
- [ ] Implementation fixes the right ownership boundary, or the narrower choice
      is recorded with reason.
- [ ] Release artifact requirement recorded: changeset, registry changelog, or
      N/A with reason.
- [ ] Final handoff shape decided: bug/feature/testing/batch/review/tracker
      requirements, PR body sync, and issue/Linear sync when applicable.
- [ ] Branch handling recorded for code-changing work: dedicated branch used,
      new branch needed, or N/A with reason.
- [ ] Local-env-rot retry policy recorded for any surprising repo-wide failure:
      reinstall/rerun evidence or N/A with reason.
- [ ] Workspace authority recorded: every proof command names the cwd/tool that
      owns the changed behavior.
- [ ] High-risk note recorded for public API, runtime, package-boundary,
      browser behavior, agent-action, or command-contract changes, or marked
      N/A with reason.
- [ ] Review/autoreview target selected from actual diff state for non-trivial
      implementation work, or marked N/A with reason.
- [ ] Agent-native review decision recorded for `.agents/**`, `.claude/**`,
      `.codex/**`, skills, hooks, commands, prompts, or user-action tooling.
- [ ] Output budget discipline recorded and followed: broad searches are
      scoped, capped, counted, or artifacted instead of streamed into goal
      context.
- [ ] Docs pack: docs lane, target docs, nearest sibling docs, and source owner are recorded.
- [ ] Docs pack: every named API, import, option, route, component, transform, demo, and preview is source-backed or marked N/A with reason.
- [ ] Docs pack: docs use current-state reference voice, not changelog voice.
- [ ] Docs pack: links, anchors, and previews target real leaf pages or are marked N/A with reason.
- [ ] Browser pack: route, interaction path, and expected visible outcome are recorded before proof.
- [ ] Browser pack: Browser proof is used for normal app surfaces; Chrome proof
      is used directly for native downloads, print/print-preview, file
      picker/uploads, clipboard, dialogs/permissions, profile/extension state,
      or exact Chrome rendering; Computer Use is used when native Chrome/OS UI
      needs visual inspection and Chrome automation cannot read it.
- [ ] Browser pack: console and network errors are checked or explicitly out of scope.
- [ ] Browser pack: screenshot or visual waiver happens only after the
      applicable Browser->Chrome->Computer path cannot inspect the state.
- [ ] Package/API pack: public API, package boundary, export, and release-artifact impact are recorded.
- [ ] Package/API pack: release artifact matrix is applied: `.changeset`, registry changelog, or explicit no-artifact reason.
- [ ] Package/API pack: `.changeset` work loads `changeset` and follows its package/version/prose rules.
- [ ] Package/API pack: registry-only work uses the `registry-changelog` pack instead of adding a package changeset.
- [ ] Package/API pack: no-artifact decisions state why the diff has no published package user-visible delta from `main`.
- [ ] Package/API pack: compatibility, migration, or hard-cut decision is explicit when public shape changes.
- [ ] Package/API pack: package-owned typecheck/build/test proof is recorded or marked N/A with reason.
- [ ] Package/API pack: generated barrels or release notes are updated when required.

  - Why not quick patch: pending
  - Why not broader change: pending
- Verified: pending
- PR body verified: pending

Task-style PR body contract:
- Preserve any existing `<!-- auto-release:start -->` block. If a changeset is
  part of the diff and repo policy expects auto release, include that block.
- Use the accepted kitcn PR #270 visual format. The body starts with an emoji
  issue/tracker/fix line, for example `🐛 Fixes #123` or `🐛 Fixes ➖ N/A`, then
  an emoji confidence line like `🟢 95-100% confidence`.
- Use this exact table header: `| Phase | 🧪 Tests | 🌐 Browser |`.
- Use `Reproduced` and `Verified` rows. Mark passing proof with `🟢`, repro or
  failing proof with `🔴`, and non-applicable cells with `➖ N/A`.
- Use bold emoji section headings: `**✅ Outcome**`, `**⚠️ Caveat**`,
  `**🏗️ Design**`, and `**🧪 Verified**`.
- Never include a line that links to the current PR itself. The current PR URL
  belongs in the final response, not in its own description.
- Do not replace this with a generic `Summary` / `Verification` PR body, an
  adaptive prose body from a git helper skill, plain `## Outcome` sections, or
  an unrelated generated badge footer unless the caller or repo template
  explicitly asks for it.
- Proof is `gh pr view --json body` output or a concise source-backed summary
  of that output.
