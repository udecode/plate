- on delete many cells:
  - replace cell children by a paragraph then reselect all the selected cells
- on get fragment (copy):
  - copying in a single cell should not copy the table anymore
- on insert fragment (paste):
  - pasting multiple blocks into many selected cells will replace these cells children by the same blocks
  - replace cell children by a paragraph then reselect all the selected cells
- on insert text:
  - it should delete the cells content by preserving the cells
- normalize cells:
  - wrap cell children in a paragraph if they are texts
- normalize selection:
  - it was easy to destroy the table structure when selection goes beyond a table. The current fix is to normalize the selection so it selects the whole table (see the specs)
