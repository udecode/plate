      By default, pasting content into a Slate editor will use the clipboard's{' '}
      <htext code>'text/plain'</htext>
      data. That's okay for some use cases, but sometimes you want users to be
      able to paste in content and have it maintain its formatting. To do this,

      data.

      formatting should be preserved.
