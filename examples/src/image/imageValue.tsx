      This example shows images in action. It features two ways to add images.
      You can either add an image via the toolbar icon above, or if you want in
      on a little secret, copy an image URL to your keyboard and paste it
      anywhere in the editor! Additionally, you can customize the toolbar button
      to load an url asynchronously, for example showing a file picker and
      uploading a file to Amazon S3. You can also add a caption and resize the
      image.
