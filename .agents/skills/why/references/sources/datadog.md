# Datadog Telemetry

## What this source contains

Datadog holds the runtime record: what actually happened in production, as opposed to what was planned or discussed.

- **Metrics.** Counters, gauges, histograms instrumented by the team. A metric's *presence* is itself evidence: someone thought this number worth watching.
- **Monitors & alerts.** Conditions the team decided warranted waking someone up. A monitor firing on `rate_limit_hit > 10/min` is direct evidence the team worried about that threshold.
- **Dashboards.** Curated views. The charts tell you what the team considers important for a subsystem.
- **APM traces & spans.** Request-level runtime data. Useful for "why is this slow" / "why is there a timeout here" questions.
- **Logs.** High-volume event records. Often contain the error conditions that motivated defensive code.
- **Incidents.** Formal incident records with timelines and linked postmortems.
- **Notebooks.** Exploratory investigations; often contain hypotheses and analyses.

Datadog answers "what was the production reality around the time this code was written?", which often explains the code's shape.

## How to search it

Use the Datadog MCP. Start broad, then narrow.

1. **Identify the owning service(s).**

   ```
   search_datadog_services (filter by name or team)
   search_datadog_service_dependencies (see upstream/downstream)
   ```

2. **Dashboards and monitors first. They tell you what the team cares about.**

   ```
   search_datadog_dashboards (query: feature name, service name, symbol)
   search_datadog_monitors   (same queries)
   ```

   When a dashboard or monitor covers the target, note its queries and watched thresholds. The threshold is frequently the answer to "why is this clamped at N?"

3. **Metrics around the target.**

   ```
   search_datadog_metrics (by name pattern, e.g., the feature or symbol)
   get_datadog_metric_context (metadata: description, units, tags)
   get_datadog_metric (timeseries; "was there a spike around the PR date?")
   ```

   Correlating a metric's trajectory with the target's add/change date is strong supporting evidence: "the `payment_timeout` metric spiked 2023-11-03, and the retry logic merged 2023-11-06."

4. **Logs. Narrow, don't dump.**

   ```
   search_datadog_logs (raw log patterns near the target, set use_log_patterns=true)
   analyze_datadog_logs (SQL-style aggregations, only when you need counts)
   ```

   Search with symbols, error strings, or feature names. **Strongly prefer time-bounded queries** (e.g., 30 days before/after the change). Log volume is huge; unconstrained searches waste time and may time out.

5. **APM spans and traces.**

   ```
   aggregate_spans    (stats: "how often does this endpoint fail?")
   search_datadog_spans (inspect individual spans)
   get_datadog_trace  (a specific trace ID)
   ```

   Useful for timeouts, retries, slow paths, and cross-service behavior.

6. **Incidents.**

   ```
   search_datadog_incidents (by title, team, date range)
   get_datadog_incident     (full detail for a specific incident)
   ```

   If the target looks defensive, search for incidents around the time it was added. An incident whose timeline includes "added defensive check for X" is near-direct evidence.

## What good evidence looks like here

- A monitor whose query and threshold match the constraint the code enforces (code clamps to 100; monitor alerts when requests exceed 100/min)
- A dashboard created by the target's author, with widgets that correspond to what the code measures or guards against
- A metric showing a production spike immediately before the code was merged, and stable values after
- An incident record referencing the target code, the same symbols, or the same error strings
- Logs showing a specific error pattern the defensive code would prevent, timestamped in the window before the change

## Common pitfalls

- **Correlation is not causation.** A spike before a PR and stabilization after is suggestive, not definitive. Other changes may have landed in the same window. Check neighboring PRs.
- **Overfitting to the chart you found.** Datadog visualizations are *made* by humans and reflect that human's framing. A chart named "retry success rate" is evidence the team cared about retry success, not that it's why a specific line of code exists.
- **Vanished telemetry.** Metrics can be renamed, deleted, or have short retention. If you can't find data from the relevant window, that's a gap, not a null result.
- **Noise at scale.** Searching logs for a common string returns thousands of matches. Narrow by service, tag, and time aggressively. Use `analyze_datadog_logs` to aggregate rather than dumping raw logs.
- **Instrumented != caused.** A metric's existence tells you someone cared enough to measure something, not that the code was added *because* of it. Cross-reference with commit/PR dates.

## What to return

For each relevant item:
- Type (dashboard / monitor / metric / log pattern / trace / incident / notebook)
- Title or name
- Link or identifier (dashboard ID, monitor ID, metric name, incident ID)
- Owner/author and created/modified date
- The specific condition, query, or quote that bears on the question (verbatim where possible)
- Relevance: what this suggests about the target code, and how strong the connection is
