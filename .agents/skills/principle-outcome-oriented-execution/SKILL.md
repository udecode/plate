# Outcome-Oriented Execution

Optimize for the intended, verifiable end state rather than preserving smooth intermediate states.

**Why:** Keeping every intermediate step fully stable often creates temporary compatibility code that becomes long-lived debt. Converge on the target architecture and prove correctness at explicit verification boundaries.

**Core rule:**
- Prioritize end-state integrity over transitional stability
- Intermediate breakage is acceptable when it is planned, scoped, and reversible
- Always run final verification before declaring done

**Guardrails:**
- Use this for planned rewrites and migrations with explicit phase boundaries
- Declare where temporary breakage is acceptable
- Keep high-signal checks for actively touched areas while migrating
- Complete the static and runtime proof required by the acceptance and owning project; repeat only invalidated or failed checks
