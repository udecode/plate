Read the [Codex runtime adapter](../poteto-mode/references/codex-runtime.md) before applying this skill. It maps platform tools and authority; the complete engineering method below remains in force.

# Setup pstack

Write `.agents/pstack-models.md`, the project role configuration that sets pstack's model per role. The skills read it and fall back to their inline defaults when a line is absent, so this is an override layer, not a requirement.

## Steps

### 1. Detect available models

Enumerate model identifiers and reasoning options exposed by the current Codex collaboration tool. Native tool metadata is the source of availability; do not infer entitlement from a model name in an upstream example. If no concrete models can be detected, retain inherit-parent and report the unavailable model inventory. Ask for a choice only if a requested override cannot be resolved. Never write a real slug you have not confirmed is available. The aliases `inherit-parent` and `auto` are always valid even though they are not detected slugs.

### 2. Load current state

The default role-to-model mapping is the rule shape shown in step 5 below. If `.agents/pstack-models.md` already exists, read it and treat its values as the current choices. Otherwise start from those defaults.

### 3. Map and confirm

Show every role with its current model, marking any real slug not in the detected set as needing a choice. Ask whether to accept as-is or change specific roles, offering the detected models plus `inherit-parent` and `auto` (both mean: this role runs on the parent chat model, which is how Auto users stay on Auto) as the options. Prefer AskQuestion over free text. For panel roles (how critics, arena runners, architect runners, interrogate reviewers) the value is a list, and one subagent runs per entry, alias entries included, so the list length sets the count. `arena cross-judge pool` is also a list, but Arena selects one value from it whose model family differs from the parent's when possible. `swarm workers` is the default model for every worker unless a race or comparison assigns another model per arm.

### 4. Validate

Every real slug written must be in the detected set; `inherit-parent` and `auto` always pass. If a chosen real slug is not available, stop and ask again. A rule pointing at a model the user cannot use breaks every delegation that reads it.

### 5. Write the rule

Write `.agents/pstack-models.md` with one line per role; the runtime adapter reads this optional file explicitly, using the same labels poteto-mode uses. Preserve roles outside the requested change; write the resolved role table once so re-runs stay idempotent. Shape:

```

# pstack model configuration. One line per role. Delete a line to fall back to the skill default.
# `inherit-parent` or `auto` as a value: the role runs on the parent chat model (omit Task `model`). Alias entries in a panel list still count toward its fan-out.

```

### 6. Confirm

Read the written file back, validate every role and model identifier, and tell the user which project configuration was updated. The skill reads this file when invoked; it does not claim to change Codex host settings. Re-running this skill updates it.

### 7. Offer a verification skill (optional)

Check whether the project has a way to drive the real app for proof (a `verify-*` skill, or an existing harness). If not, offer once: "want a project-local verification skill, so agents can drive the app the way a user does and prove changes work? I can generate one with /create-verification-skill." On yes, invoke `/create-verification-skill` (resolves wherever pstack is installed — workspace, user, or plugin). On no, move on without pushing.
