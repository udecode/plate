# Auto Review

Use the canonical [autoreview skill](https://github.com/openclaw/agent-skills/tree/main/skills/autoreview).
Read the complete installed `~/.agents/skills/autoreview/SKILL.md` and the references
it requires before reviewing. If installed at another operator-selected location,
use that installation. This repository entrypoint contains no review implementation.

If the skill is missing, reuse or clone `https://github.com/openclaw/agent-skills`
and run `python3 scripts/install-skills autoreview` from that checkout. On Windows,
use `python`; `--mode copy` is available when symlinks are unavailable.

Run the shared `scripts/autoreview` helper with Python from the repository being
reviewed, preserving its working directory. Follow this repository's review
requirements in addition to the canonical skill.

Keep shared fixes and instructions upstream in `openclaw/agent-skills`. Update
the shared checkout once for all symlinked consumers; reinstall copy-mode skills
after updating their source. Do not add repository-local helpers or test copies.
