description: 'Explore requirements and approaches through collaborative dialogue before writing a right-sized requirements document and planning implementation. Use for feature ideas, problem framing, when the user says ''let''s brainstorm'', or when they want to think through options before deciding what to build. Also use when a user describes a vague or ambitious feature request, asks ''what should we build'', ''help me think through X'', presents a problem with multiple valid solutions, or seems unsure about scope or direction — even if they don''t explicitly ask to brainstorm.'

# Brainstorm a Feature or Improvement

**Note: The current year is 2026.** Use this when dating requirements documents.

Brainstorming helps answer **WHAT** to build through collaborative dialogue. It precedes `/ce:plan`, which answers **HOW** to build it.

The durable output of this workflow is a **requirements document**. In other workflows this might be called a lightweight PRD or feature brief. In compound engineering, keep the workflow name `brainstorm`, but make the written artifact strong enough that planning does not need to invent product behavior, scope boundaries, or success criteria.

This skill does not implement code. It explores, clarifies, and documents decisions for later planning or execution.

**IMPORTANT: All file references in generated documents must use repo-relative paths (e.g., `src/models/user.rb`), never absolute paths. Absolute paths break portability across machines, worktrees, and teammates.**

## Core Principles

1. **Assess scope first** - Match the amount of ceremony to the size and ambiguity of the work.
2. **Be a thinking partner** - Suggest alternatives, challenge assumptions, and explore what-ifs instead of only extracting requirements.
3. **Resolve product decisions here** - User-facing behavior, scope boundaries, and success criteria belong in this workflow. Detailed implementation belongs in planning.
4. **Keep implementation out of the requirements doc by default** - Do not include libraries, schemas, endpoints, file layouts, or code-level design unless the brainstorm itself is inherently about a technical or architectural change.
5. **Right-size the artifact** - Simple work gets a compact requirements document or brief alignment. Larger work gets a fuller document. Do not add ceremony that does not help planning.
6. **Apply YAGNI to carrying cost, not coding effort** - Prefer the simplest approach that delivers meaningful value. Avoid speculative complexity and hypothetical future-proofing, but low-cost polish or delight is worth including when its ongoing cost is small and easy to maintain.

## Interaction Rules

1. **Ask one question at a time** - Do not batch several unrelated questions into one message.
2. **Prefer single-select multiple choice** - Use single-select when choosing one direction, one priority, or one next step.
3. **Use multi-select rarely and intentionally** - Use it only for compatible sets such as goals, constraints, non-goals, or success criteria that can all coexist. If prioritization matters, follow up by asking which selected item is primary.
4. **Use the platform's question tool when available** - When asking the user a question, prefer the platform's blocking question tool if one exists (`AskUserQuestion` in Claude Code, `request_user_input` in Codex, `ask_user` in Gemini). Otherwise, present numbered options in chat and wait for the user's reply before proceeding.

## Output Guidance

- **Keep outputs concise** - Prefer short sections, brief bullets, and only enough detail to support the next decision.
- **Use repo-relative paths** - When referencing files, use paths relative to the repo root (e.g., `src/models/user.rb`), never absolute paths. Absolute paths make documents non-portable across machines and teammates.

## Feature Description

<feature_description> #$ARGUMENTS </feature_description>

**If the feature description above is empty, ask the user:** "What would you like to explore? Please describe the feature, problem, or improvement you're thinking about."

Do not proceed until you have a feature description from the user.

## Execution Flow

### Phase 0: Resume, Assess, and Route

#### 0.1 Resume Existing Work When Appropriate

If the user references an existing brainstorm topic or document, or there is an obvious recent matching `*-requirements.md` file in `docs/brainstorms/`:
- Read the document
- Confirm with the user before resuming: "Found an existing requirements doc for [topic]. Should I continue from this, or start fresh?"
- If resuming, summarize the current state briefly, continue from its existing decisions and outstanding questions, and update the existing document instead of creating a duplicate

#### 0.2 Assess Whether Brainstorming Is Needed

**Clear requirements indicators:**
- Specific acceptance criteria provided
- Referenced existing patterns to follow
- Described exact expected behavior
- Constrained, well-defined scope

**If requirements are already clear:**
Keep the interaction brief. Confirm understanding and present concise next-step options rather than forcing a long brainstorm. Only write a short requirements document when a durable handoff to planning or later review would be valuable. Skip Phase 1.1 and 1.2 entirely — go straight to Phase 1.3 or Phase 3.

#### 0.3 Assess Scope

Use the feature description plus a light repo scan to classify the work:
- **Lightweight** - small, well-bounded, low ambiguity
- **Standard** - normal feature or bounded refactor with some decisions to make
- **Deep** - cross-cutting, strategic, or highly ambiguous

If the scope is unclear, ask one targeted question to disambiguate and then proceed.

### Phase 1: Understand the Idea

#### 1.1 Existing Context Scan

Scan the repo before substantive brainstorming. Match depth to scope:

**Lightweight** — Search for the topic, check if something similar already exists, and move on.

**Standard and Deep** — Two passes:

*Constraint Check* — Check project instruction files (`AGENTS.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` only if retained as compatibility context) for workflow, product, or scope constraints that affect the brainstorm. If these add nothing, move on.

*Topic Scan* — Search for relevant terms. Read the most relevant existing artifact if one exists (brainstorm, plan, spec, skill, feature doc). Skim adjacent examples covering similar behavior.

If nothing obvious appears after a short scan, say so and continue. Two rules govern technical depth during the scan:

1. **Verify before claiming** — When the brainstorm touches checkable infrastructure (database tables, routes, config files, dependencies, model definitions), read the relevant source files to confirm what actually exists. Any claim that something is absent — a missing table, an endpoint that doesn't exist, a dependency not in the Gemfile, a config option with no current support — must be verified against the codebase first; if not verified, label it as an unverified assumption. This applies to every brainstorm regardless of topic.

2. **Defer design decisions to planning** — Implementation details like schemas, migration strategies, endpoint structure, or deployment topology belong in planning, not here — unless the brainstorm is itself about a technical or architectural decision, in which case those details are the subject of the brainstorm and should be explored.

#### 1.2 Product Pressure Test

Before generating approaches, challenge the request to catch misframing. Match depth to scope:

**Lightweight:**
- Is this solving the real user problem?
- Are we duplicating something that already covers this?
- Is there a clearly better framing with near-zero extra cost?

**Standard:**
- Is this the right problem, or a proxy for a more important one?
- What user or business outcome actually matters here?
- What happens if we do nothing?
- Is there a nearby framing that creates more user value without more carrying cost? If so, what complexity does it add?
- Given the current project state, user goal, and constraints, what is the single highest-leverage move right now: the request as framed, a reframing, one adjacent addition, a simplification, or doing nothing?
- Favor moves that compound value, reduce future carrying cost, or make the product meaningfully more useful or compelling
- Use the result to sharpen the conversation, not to bulldoze the user's intent

**Deep** — Standard questions plus:
- What durable capability should this create in 6-12 months?
- Does this move the product toward that, or is it only a local patch?

#### 1.3 Collaborative Dialogue

Use the platform's blocking question tool when available (see Interaction Rules). Otherwise, present numbered options in chat and wait for the user's reply before proceeding.

**Guidelines:**
- Ask questions **one at a time**
- Prefer multiple choice when natural options exist
- Prefer **single-select** when choosing one direction, one priority, or one next step
- Use **multi-select** only for compatible sets that can all coexist; if prioritization matters, ask which selected item is primary
- Start broad (problem, users, value) then narrow (constraints, exclusions, edge cases)
- Clarify the problem frame, validate assumptions, and ask about success criteria
- Make requirements concrete enough that planning will not need to invent behavior
- Surface dependencies or prerequisites only when they materially affect scope
- Resolve product decisions here; leave technical implementation choices for planning
- Bring ideas, alternatives, and challenges instead of only interviewing

**Exit condition:** Continue until the idea is clear OR the user explicitly wants to proceed.

### Phase 2: Explore Approaches

If multiple plausible directions remain, propose **2-3 concrete approaches** based on research and conversation. Otherwise state the recommended direction directly.

When useful, include one deliberately higher-upside alternative:
- Identify what adjacent addition or reframing would most increase usefulness, compounding value, or durability without disproportionate carrying cost. Present it as a challenger option alongside the baseline, not as the default. Omit it when the work is already obviously over-scoped or the baseline request is clearly the right move.

For each approach, provide:
- Brief description (2-3 sentences)
- Pros and cons
- Key risks or unknowns
- When it's best suited

Lead with your recommendation and explain why. Prefer simpler solutions when added complexity creates real carrying cost, but do not reject low-cost, high-value polish just because it is not strictly necessary.

If one approach is clearly best and alternatives are not meaningful, skip the menu and state the recommendation directly.

If relevant, call out whether the choice is:
- Reuse an existing pattern
- Extend an existing capability
- Build something net new

### Phase 3: Capture the Requirements

Write or update a requirements document only when the conversation produced durable decisions worth preserving.

This document should behave like a lightweight PRD without PRD ceremony. Include what planning needs to execute well, and skip sections that add no value for the scope.

The requirements document is for product definition and scope control. Do **not** include implementation details such as libraries, schemas, endpoints, file layouts, or code structure unless the brainstorm is inherently technical and those details are themselves the subject of the decision.

**Required content for non-trivial work:**
- Problem frame
- Concrete requirements or intended behavior with stable IDs
- Scope boundaries
- Success criteria

**Include when materially useful:**
- Key decisions and rationale
- Dependencies or assumptions
- Outstanding questions
- Alternatives considered
- High-level technical direction only when the work is inherently technical and the direction is part of the product/architecture decision

**Document structure:** Use this template and omit clearly inapplicable optional sections:

```markdown
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
topic: <kebab-case-topic>
---

# <Topic Title>

## Problem Frame
[Who is affected, what is changing, and why it matters]

## Requirements

**[Group Header]**
- R1. [Concrete requirement in this group]
- R2. [Concrete requirement in this group]

**[Group Header]**
- R3. [Concrete requirement in this group]

## Success Criteria
- [How we will know this solved the right problem]

## Scope Boundaries
- [Deliberate non-goal or exclusion]

## Key Decisions
- [Decision]: [Rationale]

## Dependencies / Assumptions
- [Only include if material]

## Outstanding Questions

### Resolve Before Planning
- [Affects R1][User decision] [Question that must be answered before planning can proceed]

### Deferred to Planning
- [Affects R2][Technical] [Question that should be answered during planning or codebase exploration]
- [Affects R2][Needs research] [Question that likely requires research during planning]

## Next Steps
[If `Resolve Before Planning` is empty: `→ /ce:plan` for structured implementation planning]
[If `Resolve Before Planning` is not empty: `→ Resume /ce:brainstorm` to resolve blocking questions before planning]
```

**Visual communication** — Include a visual aid when the requirements would be significantly easier to understand with one. Visual aids are conditional on content patterns, not on depth classification — a Lightweight brainstorm about a complex workflow may warrant a diagram; a Deep brainstorm about a straightforward feature may not.

**When to include:**

| Requirements describe... | Visual aid | Placement |
|---|---|---|
| A multi-step user workflow or process | Mermaid flow diagram or ASCII flow with annotations | After Problem Frame, or under its own `## User Flow` heading for substantial flows (>10 nodes) |
| 3+ behavioral modes, variants, or states | Markdown comparison table | Within the Requirements section |
| 3+ interacting participants (user roles, system components, external services) | Mermaid or ASCII relationship diagram | After Problem Frame, or under its own `## Architecture` heading |
| Multiple competing approaches being compared | Comparison table | Within Phase 2 approach exploration |

**When to skip:**
- Prose already communicates the concept clearly
- The diagram would just restate the requirements in visual form without adding comprehension value
- The visual describes implementation architecture, data schemas, state machines, or code structure (that belongs in `ce:plan`)
- The brainstorm is simple and linear with no multi-step flows, mode comparisons, or multi-participant interactions

**Format selection:**
- **Mermaid** (default) for simple flows — 5-15 nodes, no in-box annotations, standard flowchart shapes. Use `TB` (top-to-bottom) direction so diagrams stay narrow in both rendered and source form. Source should be readable as fallback in diff views and terminals.
- **ASCII/box-drawing diagrams** for annotated flows that need rich in-box content — CLI commands at each step, decision logic branches, file path layouts, multi-column spatial arrangements. More expressive than mermaid when the diagram's value comes from annotations within steps. Follow 80-column max for code blocks, use vertical stacking.
- **Markdown tables** for mode/variant comparisons and approach comparisons.
- Keep diagrams proportionate to the content. A simple 5-step workflow gets 5-10 nodes. A complex workflow with decision branches and annotations at each step may need 15-20 nodes — that is fine if every node earns its place.
- Place inline at the point of relevance, not in a separate section.
- Conceptual level only — user flows, information flows, mode comparisons, component responsibilities. Not implementation architecture, data schemas, or code structure.
- Prose is authoritative: when a visual aid and surrounding prose disagree, the prose governs.

After generating a visual aid, verify it accurately represents the prose requirements — correct sequence, no missing branches, no merged steps. Diagrams without code to validate against carry higher inaccuracy risk than code-backed diagrams.

For **Standard** and **Deep** brainstorms, a requirements document is usually warranted.

For **Lightweight** brainstorms, keep the document compact. Skip document creation when the user only needs brief alignment and no durable decisions need to be preserved.

For very small requirements docs with only 1-3 simple requirements, plain bullet requirements are acceptable. For **Standard** and **Deep** requirements docs, use stable IDs like `R1`, `R2`, `R3` so planning and later review can refer to them unambiguously.

When requirements span multiple distinct concerns, group them under bold topic headers within the Requirements section. The trigger for grouping is distinct logical areas, not item count — even four requirements benefit from headers if they cover three different topics. Group by logical theme (e.g., "Packaging", "Migration and Compatibility", "Contributor Workflow"), not by the order they were discussed. Requirements keep their original stable IDs — numbering does not restart per group. A requirement belongs to whichever group it fits best; do not duplicate it across groups. Skip grouping only when all requirements are about the same thing.

When the work is simple, combine sections rather than padding them. A short requirements document is better than a bloated one.

Before finalizing, check:
- What would `ce:plan` still have to invent if this brainstorm ended now?
- Do any requirements depend on something claimed to be out of scope?
- Are any unresolved items actually product decisions rather than planning questions?
- Did implementation details leak in when they shouldn't have?
- Do any requirements claim that infrastructure is absent without that claim having been verified against the codebase? If so, verify now or label as an unverified assumption.
- Is there a low-cost change that would make this materially more useful?
- Would a visual aid (flow diagram, comparison table, relationship diagram) help a reader grasp the requirements faster than prose alone?

If planning would need to invent product behavior, scope boundaries, or success criteria, the brainstorm is not complete yet.

Ensure `docs/brainstorms/` directory exists before writing.

If a document contains outstanding questions:
- Use `Resolve Before Planning` only for questions that truly block planning
- If `Resolve Before Planning` is non-empty, keep working those questions during the brainstorm by default
- If the user explicitly wants to proceed anyway, convert each remaining item into an explicit decision, assumption, or `Deferred to Planning` question before proceeding
- Do not force resolution of technical questions during brainstorming just to remove uncertainty
- Put technical questions, or questions that require validation or research, under `Deferred to Planning` when they are better answered there
- Use tags like `[Needs research]` when the planner should likely investigate the question rather than answer it from repo context alone
- Carry deferred questions forward explicitly rather than treating them as a failure to finish the requirements doc

### Phase 3.5: Document Review

When a requirements document was created or updated, run the `document-review` skill on it before presenting handoff options. Pass the document path as the argument.

If document-review returns findings that were auto-applied, note them briefly when presenting handoff options. If residual P0/P1 findings were surfaced, mention them so the user can decide whether to address them before proceeding.

When document-review returns "Review complete", proceed to Phase 4.

### Phase 4: Handoff

#### 4.1 Present Next-Step Options

Present next steps using the platform's blocking question tool when available (see Interaction Rules). Otherwise present numbered options in chat and end the turn.

If `Resolve Before Planning` contains any items:
- Ask the blocking questions now, one at a time, by default
- If the user explicitly wants to proceed anyway, first convert each remaining item into an explicit decision, assumption, or `Deferred to Planning` question
- If the user chooses to pause instead, present the handoff as paused or blocked rather than complete
- Do not offer `Proceed to planning` or `Proceed directly to work` while `Resolve Before Planning` remains non-empty

**Question when no blocking questions remain:** "Brainstorm complete. What would you like to do next?"

**Question when blocking questions remain and user wants to pause:** "Brainstorm paused. Planning is blocked until the remaining questions are resolved. What would you like to do next?"

Present only the options that apply:
- **Proceed to planning (Recommended)** - Run `/ce:plan` for structured implementation planning
- **Proceed directly to work** - Only offer this when scope is lightweight, success criteria are clear, scope boundaries are clear, and no meaningful technical or research questions remain
- **Run additional document review** - Offer this only when a requirements document exists. Runs another pass for further refinement
- **Ask more questions** - Continue clarifying scope, preferences, or edge cases
- **Share to Proof** - Offer this only when a requirements document exists
- **Done for now** - Return later

If the direct-to-work gate is not satisfied, omit that option entirely.

#### 4.2 Handle the Selected Option

**If user selects "Proceed to planning (Recommended)":**

Immediately run `/ce:plan` in the current session. Pass the requirements document path when one exists; otherwise pass a concise summary of the finalized brainstorm decisions. Do not print the closing summary first.

**If user selects "Proceed directly to work":**

Immediately run `/ce:work` in the current session using the finalized brainstorm output as context. If a compact requirements document exists, pass its path. Do not print the closing summary first.

**If user selects "Share to Proof":**

```bash
CONTENT=$(cat docs/brainstorms/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-requirements.md)
TITLE="Requirements: <topic title>"
RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST https://www.proofeditor.ai/share/markdown \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "$(jq -n --arg title "$TITLE" --arg markdown "$CONTENT" --arg by "ai:compound" '{title: $title, markdown: $markdown, by: $by}')")
PROOF_URL=$(echo "$RESPONSE" | jq -r '.tokenUrl')
```

Display the URL prominently: `View & collaborate in Proof: <PROOF_URL>`

If the curl fails, skip silently. Then return to the Phase 4 options.

**If user selects "Ask more questions":** Return to Phase 1.3 (Collaborative Dialogue) and continue asking the user questions one at a time to further refine the design. Probe deeper into edge cases, constraints, preferences, or areas not yet explored. Continue until the user is satisfied, then return to Phase 4. Do not show the closing summary yet.

**If user selects "Run additional document review":**

Load the `document-review` skill and apply it to the requirements document for another pass.

When document-review returns "Review complete", return to the normal Phase 4 options and present only the options that still apply. Do not show the closing summary yet.

#### 4.3 Closing Summary

Use the closing summary only when this run of the workflow is ending or handing off, not when returning to the Phase 4 options.

When complete and ready for planning, display:

```text
Brainstorm complete!

Requirements doc: docs/brainstorms/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-requirements.md  # if one was created

Key decisions:
- [Decision 1]
- [Decision 2]

Recommended next step: `/ce:plan`
```

If the user pauses with `Resolve Before Planning` still populated, display:

```text
Brainstorm paused.

Requirements doc: docs/brainstorms/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-requirements.md  # if one was created

Planning is blocked by:
- [Blocking question 1]
- [Blocking question 2]

Resume with `/ce:brainstorm` when ready to resolve these before planning.
```
