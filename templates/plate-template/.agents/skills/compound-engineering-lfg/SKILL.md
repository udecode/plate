CRITICAL: You MUST execute every step below IN ORDER. Do NOT skip any required step. Do NOT jump ahead to coding or implementation. The plan phase (step 2) MUST be completed and verified BEFORE any work begins. Violating this order produces bad output.

1. **Optional:** If the `ralph-loop` skill is available, run `/ralph-loop:ralph-loop "finish all slash commands" --completion-promise "DONE"`. If not available or it fails, skip and continue to step 2 immediately.

2. `/ce:plan $ARGUMENTS`

   GATE: STOP. Verify that the `ce:plan` workflow produced a plan file in `docs/plans/`. If no plan file was created, run `/ce:plan $ARGUMENTS` again. Do NOT proceed to step 3 until a written plan exists.

3. `/ce:work`

   GATE: STOP. Verify that implementation work was performed - files were created or modified beyond the plan. Do NOT proceed to step 4 if no code changes were made.

4. `/ce:review mode:autofix`

5. `/compound-engineering:todo-resolve`

6. `/compound-engineering:test-browser`

7. `/compound-engineering:feature-video`

8. Output `<promise>DONE</promise>` when video is in PR

Start with step 2 now (or step 1 if ralph-loop is available). Remember: plan FIRST, then work. Never skip the plan.
