# Xcode Test Skill

Build, install, and test iOS apps on the simulator using XcodeBuildMCP. Captures screenshots, logs, and verifies app behavior.

## Prerequisites

- Xcode installed with command-line tools
- XcodeBuildMCP MCP server connected
- Valid Xcode project or workspace
- At least one iOS Simulator available

## Workflow

### 0. Verify XcodeBuildMCP is Available

Check that the XcodeBuildMCP MCP server is connected by calling its `list_simulators` tool.

MCP tool names vary by platform:
- Claude Code: `mcp__xcodebuildmcp__list_simulators`
- Other platforms: use the equivalent MCP tool call for the `XcodeBuildMCP` server's `list_simulators` method

If the tool is not found or errors, inform the user they need to add the XcodeBuildMCP MCP server:

```
XcodeBuildMCP not installed

Install via Homebrew:
  brew tap getsentry/xcodebuildmcp && brew install xcodebuildmcp

Or via npx (no global install needed):
  npx -y xcodebuildmcp@latest mcp

Then add "XcodeBuildMCP" as an MCP server in your agent configuration
and restart your agent.
```

Do NOT proceed until XcodeBuildMCP is confirmed working.

### 1. Discover Project and Scheme

Call XcodeBuildMCP's `discover_projs` tool to find available projects, then `list_schemes` with the project path to get available schemes.

If an argument was provided, use that scheme name. If "current", use the default/last-used scheme.

### 2. Boot Simulator

Call `list_simulators` to find available simulators. Boot the preferred simulator (iPhone 15 Pro recommended) using `boot_simulator` with the simulator's UUID.

Wait for the simulator to be ready before proceeding.

### 3. Build the App

Call `build_ios_sim_app` with the project path and scheme name.

**On failure:**
- Capture build errors
- Create a P1 todo for each build error
- Report to user with specific error details

**On success:**
- Note the built app path for installation
- Proceed to step 4

### 4. Install and Launch

1. Call `install_app_on_simulator` with the built app path and simulator UUID
2. Call `launch_app_on_simulator` with the bundle ID and simulator UUID
3. Call `capture_sim_logs` with the simulator UUID and bundle ID to start log capture

### 5. Test Key Screens

For each key screen in the app:

**Take screenshot:**
Call `take_screenshot` with the simulator UUID and a descriptive filename (e.g., `screen-home.png`).

**Review screenshot for:**
- UI elements rendered correctly
- No error messages visible
- Expected content displayed
- Layout looks correct

**Check logs for errors:**
Call `get_sim_logs` with the simulator UUID. Look for:
- Crashes
- Exceptions
- Error-level log messages
- Failed network requests

### 6. Human Verification (When Required)

Pause for human input when testing touches flows that require device interaction.

| Flow Type | What to Ask |
|-----------|-------------|
| Sign in with Apple | "Please complete Sign in with Apple on the simulator" |
| Push notifications | "Send a test push and confirm it appears" |
| In-app purchases | "Complete a sandbox purchase" |
| Camera/Photos | "Grant permissions and verify camera works" |
| Location | "Allow location access and verify map updates" |

Ask the user (using the platform's question tool — e.g., `AskUserQuestion` in Claude Code, `request_user_input` in Codex, `ask_user` in Gemini — or present numbered options and wait):

```
Human Verification Needed

This test requires [flow type]. Please:
1. [Action to take on simulator]
2. [What to verify]

Did it work correctly?
1. Yes - continue testing
2. No - describe the issue
```

### 7. Handle Failures

When a test fails:

1. **Document the failure:**
   - Take screenshot of error state
   - Capture console logs
   - Note reproduction steps

2. **Ask the user how to proceed:**

   ```
   Test Failed: [screen/feature]

   Issue: [description]
   Logs: [relevant error messages]

   How to proceed?
   1. Fix now - I'll help debug and fix
   2. Create todo - Add a todo for later (using the todo-create skill)
   3. Skip - Continue testing other screens
   ```

3. **If "Fix now":** investigate, propose a fix, rebuild and retest
4. **If "Create todo":** load the `todo-create` skill and create a todo with priority p1 and description `xcode-{description}`, continue
5. **If "Skip":** log as skipped, continue

### 8. Test Summary

After all tests complete, present a summary:

```markdown
## Xcode Test Results

**Project:** [project name]
**Scheme:** [scheme name]
**Simulator:** [simulator name]

### Build: Success / Failed

### Screens Tested: [count]

| Screen | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Launch | Pass | |
| Home | Pass | |
| Settings | Fail | Crash on tap |
| Profile | Skip | Requires login |

### Console Errors: [count]
- [List any errors found]

### Human Verifications: [count]
- Sign in with Apple: Confirmed
- Push notifications: Confirmed

### Failures: [count]
- Settings screen - crash on navigation

### Created Todos: [count]
- `006-pending-p1-xcode-settings-crash.md`

### Result: [PASS / FAIL / PARTIAL]
```

### 9. Cleanup

After testing:

1. Call `stop_log_capture` with the simulator UUID
2. Optionally call `shutdown_simulator` with the simulator UUID

## Quick Usage Examples

```bash
# Test with default scheme
/test-xcode

# Test specific scheme
/test-xcode MyApp-Debug

# Test after making changes
/test-xcode current
```

## Integration with ce:review

When reviewing PRs that touch iOS code, the `ce:review` workflow can spawn an agent to run this skill, build on the simulator, test key screens, and check for crashes.
