# Resolve PR Review Feedback

Evaluate and fix PR review feedback, then reply and resolve threads. Spawns parallel agents for each thread.

> **Agent time is cheap. Tech debt is expensive.**
> Fix everything valid -- including nitpicks and low-priority items. If we're already in the code, fix it rather than punt it.

## Mode Detection

| Argument | Mode |
|----------|------|
| No argument | **Full** -- all unresolved threads on the current branch's PR |
| PR number (e.g., `123`) | **Full** -- all unresolved threads on that PR |
| Comment/thread URL | **Targeted** -- only that specific thread |

**Targeted mode**: When a URL is provided, ONLY address that feedback. Do not fetch or process other threads.

---

## Full Mode

### 1. Fetch Unresolved Threads

If no PR number was provided, detect from the current branch:
```bash
gh pr view --json number -q .number
```

Then fetch all feedback using the GraphQL script at [scripts/get-pr-comments](scripts/get-pr-comments):

```bash
bash scripts/get-pr-comments PR_NUMBER
```

Returns a JSON object with three keys:

| Key | Contents | Has file/line? | Resolvable? |
|-----|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `review_threads` | Unresolved, non-outdated inline code review threads | Yes | Yes (GraphQL) |
| `pr_comments` | Top-level PR conversation comments (excludes PR author) | No | No |
| `review_bodies` | Review submission bodies with non-empty text (excludes PR author) | No | No |

If the script fails, fall back to:
```bash
gh pr view PR_NUMBER --json reviews,comments
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/PR_NUMBER/comments
```

### 2. Triage: Separate New from Pending

Before processing, classify each piece of feedback as **new** or **already handled**.

**Review threads**: Read the thread's comments. If there's a substantive reply that acknowledges the concern but defers action (e.g., "need to align on this", "going to think through this", or a reply that presents options without resolving), it's a **pending decision** -- don't re-process. If there's only the original reviewer comment(s) with no substantive response, it's **new**.

**PR comments and review bodies**: These have no resolve mechanism, so they reappear on every run. Apply two filters in order:

1. **Actionability**: Skip items that contain no actionable feedback or questions to answer. Examples: review wrapper text ("Here are some automated review suggestions..."), approvals ("this looks great!"), status badges ("Validated"), CI summaries with no follow-up asks. If there's nothing to fix, answer, or decide, it's not actionable -- drop it from the count entirely.
2. **Already replied**: For actionable items, check the PR conversation for an existing reply that quotes and addresses the feedback. If a reply already exists, skip. If not, it's new.

The distinction is about content, not who posted what. A deferral from a teammate, a previous skill run, or a manual reply all count. Similarly, actionability is about content -- bot feedback that requests a specific code change is actionable; a bot's boilerplate header wrapping those requests is not.

If there are no new items across all feedback types, skip steps 3-8 and go straight to step 9.

### 3. Cluster Analysis (Gated)

Before planning and dispatching fixes, check whether feedback patterns suggest a systemic issue that warrants broader investigation rather than individual fixes.

**Gate check**: Cluster analysis only runs when at least one signal fires. If neither fires, skip directly to step 4.

| Gate signal | Check |
|---|---|
| **Volume** | 3+ new items from triage |
| **Cross-invocation** | `cross_invocation.signal == true` in the script output (resolved threads exist alongside new ones — evidence of multi-round review) |

If the gate does not fire, proceed to step 4. The common case (first review round with 1-2 comments) skips this step entirely with zero overhead.

**If the gate fires**, analyze feedback for thematic clusters. When the cross-invocation signal fired, include resolved threads from `cross_invocation.resolved_threads` alongside new threads in the analysis — these are previously-resolved threads from earlier review rounds that provide pattern context. Mark them as `previously_resolved` so dispatch (step 5) knows not to individually re-resolve them.

1. **Assign concern categories** from this fixed list: `error-handling`, `validation`, `type-safety`, `naming`, `performance`, `testing`, `security`, `documentation`, `style`, `architecture`, `other`. Each item (new and previously-resolved) gets exactly one category based on what the feedback is about.

2. **Group by category + spatial proximity**. Two items form a potential cluster when they share a concern category AND are spatially proximate (same file, or files in the same directory subtree). Clusters can span new and previously-resolved threads.

   | Thematic match | Spatial proximity | Action |
   |---|---|---|
   | Same category | Same file | Cluster |
   | Same category | Same directory subtree | Cluster |
   | Same category | Unrelated locations | No cluster |
   | Different categories | Any | No cluster (same-file grouping still applies for conflict avoidance) |

3. **Synthesize a cluster brief** for each cluster of 2+ items. Pass briefs to agents using a `<cluster-brief>` XML block:

   ```xml
   <cluster-brief>
     <theme>[concern category]</theme>
     <area>[common directory path]</area>
     <files>[comma-separated file paths]</files>
     <threads>[comma-separated new thread/comment IDs]</threads>
     <hypothesis>[one sentence: what the individual comments collectively suggest about a deeper issue]</hypothesis>
     <prior-resolutions>
       <thread id="PRRT_..." path="..." category="..."/>
     </prior-resolutions>
   </cluster-brief>
   ```

   The `<prior-resolutions>` element lists previously-resolved threads that clustered with the new threads — their IDs, file paths, and assigned concern categories. This gives the resolver agent the full cross-round picture. When no previously-resolved threads are in the cluster, omit the element.

4. **Items not in any cluster** remain as individual items and are dispatched normally in step 5. Previously-resolved threads that don't cluster with any new thread are dropped — they provided context but no pattern was found.

5. **If no clusters are found** after analysis (the gate fired but items don't form thematic+spatial groups), proceed with all items as individual. The gate was a false positive -- the only cost was the analysis itself.

### 4. Plan

Create a task list of all **new** unresolved items grouped by type (e.g., `TaskCreate` in Claude Code, `update_plan` in Codex):
- Code changes requested
- Questions to answer
- Style/convention fixes
- Test additions needed

If step 3 produced clusters, include them in the task list as cluster items alongside individual items.

### 5. Implement (PARALLEL)

Process all three feedback types. Review threads are the primary type; PR comments and review bodies are secondary but should not be ignored.

#### Dispatch boundary for previously-resolved threads

Previously-resolved threads (from `cross_invocation.resolved_threads`) participate in clustering and appear in cluster briefs as `<prior-resolutions>` context. They are NEVER individually dispatched — they were already resolved in prior rounds. Only new threads get individual or cluster dispatch.

#### Individual dispatch (default)

**For review threads** (`review_threads`): Spawn a `compound-engineering:workflow:pr-comment-resolver` agent for each new thread that is NOT already assigned to a cluster from step 3. Clustered threads are handled by cluster dispatch below -- do not dispatch them individually.

Each agent receives:
- The thread ID
- The file path and line number
- The full comment text (all comments in the thread)
- The PR number (for context)
- The feedback type (`review_thread`)

**For PR comments and review bodies** (`pr_comments`, `review_bodies`): These lack file/line context. Spawn a `compound-engineering:workflow:pr-comment-resolver` agent for each actionable non-clustered item. The agent receives the comment ID, body text, PR number, and feedback type (`pr_comment` or `review_body`). The agent must identify the relevant files from the comment text and the PR diff.

#### Cluster dispatch

For each cluster identified in step 3, dispatch ONE `compound-engineering:workflow:pr-comment-resolver` agent that receives:
- The `<cluster-brief>` XML block
- All thread details for threads in the cluster (IDs, file paths, line numbers, comment text)
- The PR number
- The feedback types

The cluster agent reads the broader area before making targeted fixes. It returns one summary per thread it handled (same structure as individual agents), plus a `cluster_assessment` field describing what broader investigation revealed and whether a holistic or individual approach was taken.

#### Agent return format

Each agent returns a short summary:
- **verdict**: `fixed`, `fixed-differently`, `replied`, `not-addressing`, or `needs-human`
- **feedback_id**: the thread ID or comment ID it handled
- **feedback_type**: `review_thread`, `pr_comment`, or `review_body`
- **reply_text**: the markdown reply to post (quoting the relevant part of the original feedback)
- **files_changed**: list of files modified (empty if replied/not-addressing)
- **reason**: brief explanation of what was done or why it was skipped

Cluster agents additionally return:
- **cluster_assessment**: what the broader investigation found, whether a holistic or individual approach was taken

Verdict meanings:
- `fixed` -- code change made as requested
- `fixed-differently` -- code change made, but with a better approach than suggested
- `replied` -- no code change needed; answered a question, acknowledged feedback, or explained a design decision
- `not-addressing` -- feedback is factually wrong about the code; skip with evidence
- `needs-human` -- cannot determine the right action; needs user decision

#### Batching and conflict avoidance

**Batching**: Clusters count as 1 dispatch unit regardless of how many threads they contain. If there are 1-4 dispatch units total (clusters + individual items), dispatch all in parallel. For 5+ dispatch units, batch in groups of 4.

**Conflict avoidance**: No two dispatch units that touch the same file should run in parallel. Before dispatching, check for file overlaps across all dispatch units (clusters and individual items). If a cluster's file list overlaps with an individual item's file, or with another cluster's files, serialize those units -- dispatch one, wait for it to complete, then dispatch the next. Non-overlapping units can still run in parallel. Within a single dispatch unit handling multiple threads on the same file, the agent addresses them sequentially.

**Sequential fallback**: Platforms that do not support parallel dispatch should run agents sequentially. Dispatch cluster units first (they are higher-leverage), then individual items.

Fixes can occasionally expand beyond their referenced file (e.g., renaming a method updates callers elsewhere). This is rare but can cause parallel agents to collide. The verification step (step 8) catches this -- if re-fetching shows unresolved threads or if the commit reveals inconsistent changes, re-run the affected agents sequentially.

### 6. Commit and Push

After all agents complete, check whether any files were actually changed. If all verdicts are `replied`, `not-addressing`, or `needs-human` (no code changes), skip this step entirely and proceed to step 7.

If there are file changes:

1. Stage only files reported by sub-agents and commit with a message referencing the PR:

```bash
git add [files from agent summaries]
git commit -m "Address PR review feedback (#PR_NUMBER)

- [list changes from agent summaries]"
```

2. Push to remote:
```bash
git push
```

### 7. Reply and Resolve

After the push succeeds, post replies and resolve where applicable. The mechanism depends on the feedback type.

#### Reply format

All replies should quote the relevant part of the original feedback for continuity. Quote the specific sentence or passage being addressed, not the entire comment if it's long.

For fixed items:
```markdown
> [quoted relevant part of original feedback]

Addressed: [brief description of the fix]
```

For items not addressed:
```markdown
> [quoted relevant part of original feedback]

Not addressing: [reason with evidence, e.g., "null check already exists at line 85"]
```

For `needs-human` verdicts, post the reply but do NOT resolve the thread. Leave it open for human input.

#### Review threads

1. **Reply** using [scripts/reply-to-pr-thread](scripts/reply-to-pr-thread):
```bash
echo "REPLY_TEXT" | bash scripts/reply-to-pr-thread THREAD_ID
```

2. **Resolve** using [scripts/resolve-pr-thread](scripts/resolve-pr-thread):
```bash
bash scripts/resolve-pr-thread THREAD_ID
```

#### PR comments and review bodies

These cannot be resolved via GitHub's API. Reply with a top-level PR comment referencing the original:

```bash
gh pr comment PR_NUMBER --body "REPLY_TEXT"
```

Include enough quoted context in the reply so the reader can follow which comment is being addressed without scrolling.

### 8. Verify

Re-fetch feedback to confirm resolution:

```bash
bash scripts/get-pr-comments PR_NUMBER
```

The `review_threads` array should be empty (except `needs-human` items).

**If new threads remain**, check the iteration count for this run:

- **First or second fix-verify cycle**: Repeat from step 2 for the remaining threads. The re-fetch in step 1 will pick up threads resolved in earlier cycles as resolved threads in `cross_invocation`, so the cross-invocation gate (step 3) will fire naturally if patterns emerge across cycles.

- **After the second fix-verify cycle** (3rd pass would begin): Stop looping. Surface remaining issues to the user with context about the recurring pattern: "Multiple rounds of feedback on [area/theme] suggest a deeper issue. Here's what we've fixed so far and what keeps appearing." Use the same `needs-human` escalation pattern -- leave threads open and present the pattern for the user to decide.

PR comments and review bodies have no resolve mechanism, so they will still appear in the output. Verify they were replied to by checking the PR conversation.

### 9. Summary

Present a concise summary of all work done. Group by verdict, one line per item describing *what was done* not just *where*. This is the primary output the user sees.

Format:

```
Resolved N of M new items on PR #NUMBER:

Fixed (count): [brief description of each fix]
Fixed differently (count): [what was changed and why the approach differed]
Replied (count): [what questions were answered]
Not addressing (count): [what was skipped and why]
```

If any clusters were investigated, append a cluster investigation section:

```
Cluster investigations (count):

1. [theme] in [area]: [cluster_assessment from the agent --
   what was found, whether a holistic or individual approach was taken]
```

If any agent returned `needs-human`, append a decisions section. These are rare but high-signal. Each `needs-human` agent returns a `decision_context` field with a structured analysis: what the reviewer said, what the agent investigated, why it needs a decision, concrete options with tradeoffs, and the agent's lean if it has one.

Present the `decision_context` directly -- it's already structured for the user to read and decide quickly:

```
Needs your input (count):

1. [decision_context from the agent -- includes quoted feedback,
   investigation findings, why it needs a decision, options with
   tradeoffs, and the agent's recommendation if any]
```

The `needs-human` threads already have a natural-sounding acknowledgment reply posted and remain open on the PR.

If there are **pending decisions from a previous run** (threads detected in step 2 as already responded to but still unresolved), surface them after the new work:

```
Still pending from a previous run (count):

1. [Thread path:line] -- [brief description of what's pending]
   Previous reply: [link to the existing reply]
   [Re-present the decision options if the original context is available,
   or summarize what was asked]
```

If a blocking question tool is available, use it to ask about all pending decisions (both new `needs-human` and previous-run pending) together. If there are only pending decisions and no new work was done, the summary is just the pending items.

If a blocking question tool is available (`AskUserQuestion` in Claude Code, `request_user_input` in Codex, `ask_user` in Gemini), use it to present the decisions and wait for the user's response. After they decide, process the remaining items: fix the code, compose the reply, post it, and resolve the thread.

If no question tool is available, present the decisions in the summary output and wait for the user to respond in conversation. If they don't respond, the items remain open on the PR for later handling.

## Targeted Mode

When a specific comment or thread URL is provided:

### 1. Extract Thread Context

Parse the URL to extract OWNER, REPO, PR number, and comment REST ID:
```
https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/pull/NUMBER#discussion_rCOMMENT_ID
```

**Step 1** -- Get comment details and GraphQL node ID via REST (cheap, single comment):
```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/comments/COMMENT_ID \
  --jq '{node_id, path, line, body}'
```

**Step 2** -- Map comment to its thread ID. Use [scripts/get-thread-for-comment](scripts/get-thread-for-comment):
```bash
bash scripts/get-thread-for-comment PR_NUMBER COMMENT_NODE_ID [OWNER/REPO]
```

This fetches thread IDs and their first comment IDs (minimal fields, no bodies) and returns the matching thread with full comment details.

### 2. Fix, Reply, Resolve

Spawn a single `compound-engineering:workflow:pr-comment-resolver` agent for the thread. Then follow the same commit -> push -> reply -> resolve flow as Full Mode steps 6-7.
