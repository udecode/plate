Read task_plan.md from the current project directory and display a compact status summary.

## What to Show

1. **Current Phase**: Extract from "## Current Phase" section
2. **Phase Progress**: Count phases and their status (pending/in_progress/complete)
3. **Phase List**: Show each phase with status icon
4. **Errors**: Count entries in "## Errors Encountered" table if present
5. **Files Check**: Confirm which planning files exist

## Status Icons

- `[ ]` or "pending" → ⏸️
- "in_progress" → 🔄
- `[x]` or "complete" → ✅
- "failed" or "blocked" → ❌

## Output Format

```
📋 Planning Status

Current: Phase {N} of {total} ({percent}%)
Status: {status_icon} {status_text}

  {icon} Phase 1: {name}
  {icon} Phase 2: {name} ← you are here

  ...

## Keep It Brief

This is a quick status check, not a full report. Show just enough to answer "where am I?" without re-reading all the files.
