### AI SDK

Plate AI is depending on the [ai](https://npmjs.com/package/ai) package:

- Setup your [api](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/getting-started/nextjs-app-router#create-a-route-handler) using [streamText](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-core/generating-text#streamtext).
- Wire up [useChat](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat) in your [AI menu](#ai-menu) component.

## Wire up the UI

### AI Menu

Work in progress.

{/* ## AI Menu Items

Before learning how to create custom commands, you need to know that the ai plugin will provide three modes for opening the ai menu:

1. Cursor mode: open the AI menu at the end of a block.
2. Selection mode: select some texts and open the AI menu.
3. Block selection mode: select some blocks and open the AI menu. 
4. After the AI completes the first generation, we don't close the AI menu but instead modify the commands. We call it **Suggestion** mode.

Due to the special nature of Suggestion mode: whether Cursor mode or Selection mode ends, it will switch to Suggestion mode. 
To distinguish between these two sets of commands, we need to maintain four different menus in total.

The following is all the commands you can see in the `ai-menu-items.tsx` file.
menuState (draft doc)
  - Show when you open the ai menu by `space` at the end of a block.
  - Show when you open the ai menu by `space` and then complete the first generation.
  - Show when you open the ai menu with selected text.
  - Show when you open the ai menu with selected blocks, then complete the first generation.

If you want to modify the AI Menu style, you should check the [menu](/docs/components/menu) component docs. */}


## Examples

### Plate UI

Work in progress.

### Plate Plus

<div className="my-6 border rounded-md overflow-hidden">
  <iframe src="https://potion.platejs.org/ai-menu?hidden-sidebar=true&iframe-blank=true" title="Potion" width="100%" height="700px" />
</div>

- Context menu to open the ai menu
- Slash command to open the ai menu
- Beautifully crafted UI

## Plugins

### AIPlugin

Extends the editor with AI transforms.

### AIChatPlugin

Enables chat operations and streaming text generation in the editor.

<APIOptions>
<APIItem name="mode" type="string" optional def>
Internal state. Specifies how the assistant message is handled:

- `'insert'`: Directly inserts content into the editor without preview.
- `'chat'`: Initiates an interactive session to review and refine content
  before insertion (default).

</APIItem>
</APIOptions>

// todo: add 
- `scrollContainerSelector`
  - The selector of the scroll container.When we trigger the menu in the very bottom of the page, 
  we need this option to make the scroll container scroll up to show the menu completely.
- `createAIEditor`
  - When we use selection mode, we render a read-only editor on the AI menu, and the plugins used by this editor are provided by this option

## API

### editor.aiChat.hide()

Hides the AI menu by setting the open editor ID to null and removing the anchor element.

### editor.aiChat.show()

Shows the AI menu for the specified editor, DOM element, and node entry.

<APIParameters>
  <APIItem name="editorId" type="string">
    The ID of the editor to show the AI menu for.
  </APIItem>
  <APIItem name="dom" type="HTMLElement">
    The DOM element to anchor the AI menu to.
  </APIItem>
  <APIItem name="nodeEntry" type="NodeEntry">
    The node entry associated with the AI menu.
  </APIItem>
</APIParameters>
















{/* ## Selection Overlay

**SelectionOverlayPlugin** is part of the [CursorOverlayPlugin](/docs/components/cursor-overlay) Make sure you have installed it.

The `SelectionOverlayPlugin` is used to display a selection overlay on the editor. It enhances the visual feedback for users:

When the editor loses focus (blur event): It maintains a visual representation of the last selection.

So this plugin is userful when we open the ai menu. for example: 

We selected two paragraphs of text. and then using floating toolbar open the ai menu
Normally, these two paragraphs wouldn’t display a blue background. 
because our focus has already moved to the input box editor is blurred.

<Image src="/ai-selection.png" alt="AI selection overlay" width={1920} height={1080} className="w-full" />

Sometimes we want to keep lose the selection highlight.In this case, You can use `data-plate-prevent-overlay` attribute add to the button which trigger the blur event.

For example, in the turn into dropdown menu:
We’ve already prevented the default event so that clicking the ‘Turn Into’ menu doesn’t cause the editor to lose focus. 
Therefore, there’s no need to enable the SelectionOverlayPlugin functionality; otherwise, two layers of selection would appear, 
which would look visually unappealing.

```tsx

      <DropdownMenuContent
        className="min-w-0"
        onCloseAutoFocus={onCloseAutoFocus}
        data-plate-prevent-overlay
        align="start"
      >
      ...
      </DropdownMenuContent>
```



Therefore, just remember one rule: only use this plugin when you need to move the focus to an external input element, 
such as the AI menu or math equation plugins. */}
