  The core types will be the default of Slate in the near future, see [this

Plate delivers a structured typing layer built on top of Slate, which primarily employs [generic types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html).

**Differences with Slate types:**

- **`Editor` type:** Plate introduces **`TEditor<V>`**, where **`V`** symbolizes the "value" that Slate edits. In a generic editor, **`V`** would correspond to **`TElement[]`**, as this is what the editor accepts as children. However, in a custom editor, **`V`** might be defined as **`TEditor<Array<Paragraph | Quote>>`**.
- **Methods related to `TEditor` and `TNode`:** These methods have also been made generic. For instance, when you call **`getLeafNode(editor, path)`**, it is recognized that the return value is a **`TText`** node. More specifically, it recognizes the text node of the type defined in your custom elements, along with any marks you've defined. The **`TEditor`** type in Plate does not correspond to the **`Editor`** type in Slate, hence, Plate has introduced type-only forks of all Slate methods that use **`Editor`**, which you **should** utilize. See the full list in [Slate](/docs/api/slate) and [Slate React](/docs/api/slate-react).
- **Declaration merging approach:** Plate's use of generic types supersedes the declaration merging approach, offering several benefits. One issue with declaration merging was the inability to distinguish between an "unknown" and a "known" element as the underlying type was changed. Similarly, managing two editors on a page with different schemas was not possible. The use of generics in Plate, however, can smoothly replace the declaration merging approach while facilitating an easy migration. You can continue to pass the same custom element definitions into **`TEditor`**.

**Example of Defining Types in `plate-types.ts`:**

The following example outlines the types in **`plate-types.ts`**:

- The **`MyValue`** type, which will serve as the type of our **`editor.children`**.
- **`MyValue`** is a crucial type since most core types derive from it.
- Types following **`MyValue`** are optional, yet highly recommended. The process of writing generic types can be repetitive, so aim to do it just once.
- A set of typed functions are also included for your use.

**Naming Convention:**

- We use **`T...Element`** because **`...Element`** is already utilized by Plate UI components, and we wish to avoid naming conflicts among imports. The **`T...`** prefix also differentiates Plate types from Slate types.
- **`My`** is used for consumer types of the library. It's succinct and unambiguous. You could substitute it with the tag name of your project.
