description: Rich-text editor plugin system for Slate & React.
---

Plate is a powerful toolkit that makes it easier for you to develop with [Slate](https://docs.slatejs.org/), a popular framework for building text editors. Plate focuses on four main areas: **Core**, **Plugins**, **Primitives** and **Components**.

## Core

The heart of Plate is its plugin system, specially designed for `slate-react`. It helps keep your project organized and efficient by separating different functionalities and keeping things clean.

## Plugins

Plate offers a wide range of plugin packages that enhance the behavior, hooks, serialization, normalization, and other features of the editor. These plugins are "headless," meaning they are unstyled by default.

## Primitives

In addition to plugins, Plate provides unstyled and accessible components based on [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/). These components serve as the foundation for building high-quality design systems.

## Components

To help you get started with a visually appealing interface, Plate offers pre-built styled components you can own using our CLI. These components, based on [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), can be used as a reference or starting point for your own component library, enabling you to create a unique, accessible, and visually pleasing user interface.
