Plate Cloud is the official Plate plugin and cloud service for image and attachment uploads, automatic server-side image resizing, and future Plate cloud services.

It supports:

- Drag and drop uploading of images and attachments
- Paste uploading of images and attachments
- Using a file picker for uploading images and attachment
- Drag resize of images with server-side image resizing which optimizes download speed
- Automatically delivers high DPI images to high DPI devices and normal sized images to everyone else

Your usage of Plate Cloud supports the development of Plate.

You can start by [getting a free Portive API key](https://admin.portive.com/).

### Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @udecode/plate
npm install @udecode/plate-cloud
```

### Usage

To use Plate Cloud, you will need to [get a free Portive API key](https://www.portive.com/).

To get the value to save to your database, use `editor.cloud.getSaveValue()`. This is required for Plate Cloud because of the asynchronous nature of uploads.
