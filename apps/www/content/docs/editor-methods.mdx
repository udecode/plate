This guide covers the various methods available on the Plate editor instance.

## Accessing the Editor

How you access the editor instance depends on the context in which you need it.

### Below Plate

Use one of these hooks:

- `useEditorRef`: Never re-render.
- `useEditorSelector`: Re-render only when a specific editor property changes.
- `useEditorState`: Re-render on every change.

```ts
import { useEditorRef, useEditorSelector, useEditorState } from '@udecode/plate-common/react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const editor = useEditorRef();
  const hasSelection = useEditorSelector((editor) => !!editor.selection, []);
  const editorState = useEditorState();
  
  // ...
};
```

#### useEditorRef

- Use a reference to editor that never gets replaced. This should be the default choice.
- Since editor is a mutable object that gets updated by reference, `useEditorRef` is always sufficient for accessing the editor inside callbacks.
- `useEditorRef` will never cause your component to re-render, so it's the best choice for performance.

#### useEditorSelector

- Subscribe to a specific selector based on editor. This is the most performant option for subscribing to state changes.
- Example usage: `const hasSelection = useEditorSelector((editor) => !!editor.selection, []);`
- When you want your component to re-render in response to a specific change that you're interested in, you can use `useEditorSelector` to access the relevant property.
- The selector function is called every time the editor changes (i.e. on every keystroke or selection change), but the component only re-renders when the return value changes.
- For this to work properly, you should make sure that the return value can be compared using `===`. In most cases, this means returning a primitive value, like a number, string or boolean.
- You can provide a custom `equalityFn` in the options to `useEditorSelector` for cases where `===` isn't sufficient.
- If the selector function depends on any locally scoped variables, you should include these in the dependency list.

#### useEditorState

- Re-render every time the editor changes.
- Using `useEditorState` will cause your component to re-render every time the user presses a key or changes the selection.
- This may cause performance issues for large documents, or when re-rendering is particularly expensive.

### Outside Plate

To access the editor outside the `Plate` component or work with multiple editors, use the `PlateController` component:

```ts
import { PlateController } from '@udecode/plate-common/react';

const App = () => (
  <PlateController>
    <Toolbar />
    <MyEditor />
  </PlateController>
);

const Toolbar = () => {
  const editor = useEditorState();
  const isMounted = useEditorMounted();
  // Use editor methods here
};
```

`PlateController` manages active editors:
- The first mounted editor is active by default (override with `primary={false}` on `Plate`).
- Focus changes the active editor.
- An editor remains active until another is focused or it unmounts.

Hooks like `useEditorRef` and `useEditorSelector` work with the active editor inside `PlateController`. If no editor is active, they return a fallback editor, which:
- Provides default values for queries.
- Cannot be mutated.
- Throws errors on state-changing operations.

Fallback editor scenarios:
- No mounted `Plate` components.
- All `Plate` components are non-primary.
- During `PlateContent` mounting.

You can check if any editor is mounted using `useEditorMounted`:

```ts
const Toolbar = () => {
  const editor = useEditorState();
  const isMounted = useEditorMounted();
  
  if (!isMounted) {
    return <div>Editor not ready</div>;
  }
  
  return <div>{/* Toolbar content */}</div>;
};
```

You can also use `editor.isFallback` to check if the editor is a fallback instance.

## API Methods

### getApi

Retrieve the typed API for the editor:

```ts
const api = editor.getApi(TablePlugin);
api.api.create.cell(); // Type-safe API method
```

### getTransforms

Get the typed transforms for the editor:

```ts
const tf = editor.getTransforms(TablePlugin);
tf.insert.tableRow(); // Type-safe transform method
```

## Plugin Methods

### getPlugin

Retrieve the editor plugin instance by its key or base plugin:

```ts
const paragraphPlugin = editor.getPlugin(ParagraphPlugin);
const headingPlugin = editor.getPlugin({ key: 'heading' });
```

### getType

Get the node type associated with a plugin:

```ts
const paragraphType = editor.getType(ParagraphPlugin);
```

## Option Methods

### getOption

Get a specific option value for a plugin:

```ts
const search = editor.getOption(FindReplacePlugin, 'search');
```

### getOptions

Get all options for a plugin:

```ts
const linkOptions = editor.getOptions(LinkPlugin);
```

### setOption

Set a specific option value for a plugin:

```ts
editor.setOption(FindReplacePlugin, 'search', 'hello');
```

### setOptions

Set multiple options for a plugin:

```ts
editor.setOptions(FindReplacePlugin, {
  search: 'hello',
  caseSensitive: true,
});
```

You can also use a function to update options using Immer:

```ts
editor.setOptions(FindReplacePlugin, (draft) => {
  draft.search = 'hello';
  draft.caseSensitive = true;
});
```

### getOptionsStore

Get the <Link href="https://github.com/udecode/zustand-x">zustand-x</Link> options store for a plugin:

```ts
const store = editor.getOptionsStore(FindReplacePlugin);
```

## React Hooks

### useOption

Subscribe to a specific option value in a React component:

```ts
const MyComponent = () => {
  const search = editor.useOption(FindReplacePlugin, 'search');
  return <div>Current search: {search}</div>;
};
```

### useOptions

You can also use a selector function to subscribe to specific parts of the options:

```ts
const MyComponent = () => {
  const search = editor.useOptions(FindReplacePlugin, (options) => options.search);
  return <div>Current search: {search}</div>;
};
```

### useOptionsStore

Get the <Link href="https://github.com/udecode/zustand-x">zustand-x</Link> store hook for a plugin:

```ts
const store = editor.useOptionsStore(FindReplacePlugin);
```

## Plate Store

### setPlateState

Update the global Plate state:

```ts
editor.setPlateState('readOnly', true);
```
