<Steps>

### Create project

Run the `init` command to create a new Next.js project or to setup an existing one:

```bash
npx shadcx@latest init -u https://platejs.org/r
```

### Configure components.json

You will be asked a few questions to configure `components.json`:

```txt showLineNumbers
Which color would you like to use as base color? › Slate
Do you want to use CSS variables for colors? › no / yes
```

### Add components

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx shadcx@latest add paragraph-element -r plate
```

The command above will add the `ParagraphElement` component to your project.

### Register components

To add more components to your plugins, see [Plugin Components](/docs/plugin-components#register-components).
