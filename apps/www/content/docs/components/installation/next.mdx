<Steps>

### Create project

Run the `init` command to create a new Next.js project or to setup an existing one:

```bash
npx shadcx@latest init -u https://platejs.org/r -n plate
```

If you want to use [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) combined with Plate UI, run instead:

```bash
npx shadcx@latest init
npx shadcx@latest init -u https://platejs.org/r -n plate
```

### Configure components.json

You will be asked a few questions to configure `components.json`:

```txt showLineNumbers
Which color would you like to use as base color? › Slate
Do you want to use CSS variables for colors? › no / yes
```

### Add icons

Add the icons you'll use in `components/icons.tsx`:

<ComponentSource src="../../templates/plate-playground-template/src/components/icons.tsx" />

We use icons from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev). You can use any icon library you want.

### Add components

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx shadcx@latest add paragraph-element -r plate
```

The command above will add the `ParagraphElement` component to your project.

### Register components

To add more components to your plugins, see [Plugin Components](/docs/plugin-components#register-components).
