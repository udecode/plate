WIP – We're migrating to <Link href="https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli">npx shadcn</Link>.
</Callout>

{/* <Callout>

**Note:** We are now using the `shadcn` CLI.

</Callout>

## init

Use the `init` command to initialize configuration and dependencies for a new project.

The `init` command installs dependencies, adds the `cn` util, configures `tailwind.config.js`, and CSS variables for the project.

```bash
npx @udecode/plate-ui@latest init
```

You will be asked a few questions to configure `components.json`:

```txt showLineNumbers
Which style would you like to use? › Default
Which color would you like to use as base color? › Slate
Do you want to use CSS variables for colors? › yes
```

To have the same look than Plate UI, you should:

- Pick "Default" for the style. Plate does not have the "New York" style.
- Pick "Slate" for the base color.
- Pick "Yes" for using CSS variables.

You should get something like this:

```txt
npx shadcn@latest init
Need to install the following packages:
shadcn@2.0.7
Ok to proceed? (y) y

✔ Preflight checks.
✔ Verifying framework. Found Next.js.
✔ Validating Tailwind CSS.
✔ Validating import alias.
✔ Which style would you like to use? › Default
✔ Which color would you like to use as the base color? › Slate
✔ Would you like to use CSS variables for theming? … no / yes
✔ Writing components.json.
✔ Checking registry.
✔ Updating tailwind.config.js
✔ Updating src/styles/globals.css
✔ Installing dependencies.
✔ Created 1 file:
  - src/lib/utils.ts

Success! Project initialization completed.
You may now add components.
```
