## init

Use the `init` command to initialize configuration and dependencies for a new project.

The `init` command installs dependencies, adds the `cn` util, configures `tailwind.config.js`, and CSS variables for the project.

```bash
npx plate-ui init
```

You will be asked a few questions to configure `components.json`:

```txt showLineNumbers
Which style would you like to use? › Default
Which color would you like to use as base color? › Slate
Where is your global CSS file? › src/style/globals.css
Do you want to use CSS variables for colors? › no / yes
Where is your tailwind.config.js located? › tailwind.config.js
Configure the import alias for components: › @/components
Configure the import alias for utils: › @/lib/utils
Are you using React Server Components? › no / yes
```

```

```diff /pl-6/
      ref={ref}
    - className={cn('my-1 border-l-2 pl-4 italic', className)}
