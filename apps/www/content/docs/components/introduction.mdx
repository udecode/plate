title: Introduction
description: Re-usable components built using shadcn/ui, Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
---

This is **NOT** a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

**What do you mean by not a component library?**

We mean you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm.

Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs. The code is yours.

_Use this as a reference to build your own component libraries._

## FAQ

Is it a replacement to shadcn/ui?

</AccordionTrigger>
<AccordionContent>

No, it's not a replacement to [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).
Instead, Plate UI an extended collection of components built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/), specifically designed for **rich-text editor** design. For other parts of your app, you should continue to use other components such as [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

Plate UI adheres to the same conventions, usage, and patterns as [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), meaning you can seamlessly integrate it with your existing [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components rather than replacing them.

Next to [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), Plate UI is the first published component registry.

Why copy/paste and not packaged as a dependency?
</AccordionTrigger>
<AccordionContent>
The idea behind this is to give you ownership and control over the code, allowing you to decide how the components are built and styled.

Start with some sensible defaults, then customize the components to your needs.

One of the drawback of packaging the components in an npm package is that the style is coupled with the implementation. _The design of your components should be separate from their implementation._
