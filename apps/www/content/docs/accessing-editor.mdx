title: Accessing the Editor
description: Getting a reference to the editor instance
---

To do most things with Plate, you'll need to access the **`editor`** instance at one point or another. The way you'll do this depends on the context in which you need to access the **`editor`**.

## From Inside a Plugin

Most often, when you want to extend the functionality of your editor, you'll create a [custom Plate plugin](/docs/plugin). Luckily, plugins are one of the easiest places to access the **`editor`** instance.

### Inside Event Handlers

Use the first argument of the handler function.

```ts showLineNumbers {4,7}
const createMyPlugin = createPlugin({
  key: 'my',
  handlers: {
    onKeyDown: (editor) => (event) => {
      // Do something with editor
    },
    onChange: (editor) => (value) => {
      // Do something with editor
    },
  },
});
```

### Using the Then Option

The purpose of the **`then`** option is to access the **`editor`** instance in plugin options that normally don't have access to it. Pass a function that takes an **`editor`** and returns an object to be merged with the top-level plugin options.

For example, suppose you had this code and wanted to access the **`editor`** instance inside **`deserializeHtml`**:

```ts showLineNumbers
const MyPlugin = createPlugin({
  key: 'my',
  deserializeHtml: {
    // Need editor here
  },
});
```

You would wrap the **`deserializeHtml`** option inside **`then`**.

```ts showLineNumbers {3,7}
const MyPlugin = createPlugin({
  key: 'my',
  then: (editor) => ({
    deserializeHtml: {
      // Do something with editor
    },
  }),
});
```

## From a Child of Plate

Use the **`useEditorRef`**, **`useEditorSelector`** or **`useEditorState`** hooks. Which of these hooks you should use depends on when you want your component to re-render in response to changes to **`editor`**.

- **`useEditorRef`** - Use a reference to **`editor`** that almost never gets replaced. **This should be the default choice.**
  - Since **`editor`** is a mutable object that gets updated by reference, **`useEditorRef`** is always sufficient for accessing the **`editor`** inside callbacks.
  - **`useEditorRef`** will almost never cause your component to re-render, so it's the best choice for performance.
- **`useEditorSelector`** - Subscribe to a specific selector based on **`editor`**. **This is the most performant option for subscribing to state changes.**
  - Example usage: `const hasSelection = useEditorSelector((editor) => !!editor.selection, []);`
  - When you want your component to re-render in response to a specific change that you're interested in, you can use **`useEditorSelector`** to access the relevant property.
  - The selector function is called every time the **`editor`** changes (i.e. on every keystroke or selection change), but the component only re-renders when the return value changes.
    - For this to work properly, you should make sure that the return value can be compared using `===`. In most cases, this means returning a primitive value, like a number, string or boolean.
    - You can provide a custom **`equalityFn`** in the options to **`useEditorSelector`** for cases where `===` isn't sufficient.
  - If the selector function depends on any locally scoped variables, you should include these in the dependency list.
- **`useEditorState`** - Re-render every time the **`editor`** changes.
  - Using **`useEditorState`** will cause your component to re-render every time the user presses a key or changes the selection.
  - This may cause performance issues for large documents, or when re-rendering is particularly expensive.

You can call these hooks from any React component that is rendered as a descendant of the **`Plate`** component, including [Plugin Components](/docs/plugin-components).

```tsx showLineNumbers {2}
const Toolbar = () => {
  const boldActive = useEditorSelector((editor) => isMarkActive(editor, BoldPlugin.key), []);
  // ...
};

const Editor = () => (
  <Plate>
    <Toolbar />
    <PlateContent />
  </Plate>
);
```

```tsx showLineNumbers {6}
const ParagraphElement = ({
  className,
  children,
  ...props
}: PlateElementProps) => {
  const editor = useEditorRef();

  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    console.info('You clicked on a paragraph, and the editor is ', editor);
  }, [editor]);

  return (
    <PlateElement asChild className={className} {...props}>
      <p onClick={handleClick}>{children}</p>
    </PlateElement>
  );
};
```

One common pattern is to add an effect component as a child of **`Plate`** that consumes **`editor`** and returns **`null`**.

```tsx showLineNumbers {2,17}
const CustomEffect = () => {
  const editor = useEditorRef();

  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      console.info('The editor is ', editor);
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, [editor]);

  return null;
};

export default () => (
  <Plate>
    <CustomEffect />

    <PlateContent />
  </Plate>
);
```

<Callout className="my-4">
  **If `editor` is modified by reference, why include it in dependency
  lists?**
  <br />
  Good question! Even though **`editor`** is usually modified by reference,
  there are some situations in which it's replaced with a fresh instance, such
  as when the editor is reset.
</Callout>

## From a Sibling or Ancestor of Plate

If you need to access the **`editor`** outside of the **`Plate`** component, or if you're working with multiple editors and want to access whichever editor is currently active, you can use a **`PlateController`** component. **`PlateController`** is an optional component that can be rendered as an ancestor of one or more **`Plate`** components. For example, you can render a **`PlateController`** at the root of your app.

The **`PlateController`** will keep track of which editor is currently active. By default, the first mounted editor inside the **`PlateController`** will be used as the active editor (this can be disabled for individual editors by passing **`primary={false}`** to the **`Plate`** component). After that, every time an editor is focused, that editor becomes active. An editor remains active until another editor is focused or the active editor unmounts.

Inside a **`PlateController`**, hooks like **`useEditorRef`** and **`useEditorSelector`** will return or operate on the currently active editor. If no editor is active, these hooks may return a fallback editor. This can happen under the following circumstances:

- When no **`Plate`** component is mounted inside the **`PlateController`**
- When all mounted **`Plate`** components are marked as non-primary
- Temporarily while **`PlateContent`** is in the process of mounting

The fallback editor is designed to ensure that code querying the **`editor`** produces sensible default values, the same as if they had been given an empty editor with no plugins. The fallback editor cannot be mutated, and will throw a runtime error if any state-changing operations are applied to it. To check if your component is accessing a real editor or a fallback editor, use the **`useEditorMounted`** hook (which returns false for a fallback editor), or check **`editor.isFallback`**.

```tsx showLineNumbers {2-3,9,19}
const Toolbar = () => {
  const editor = useEditorState(); // Returns the active editor (or a fallback editor)
  const isMounted = useEditorMounted(); // Returns false if no editor is mounted
  // ...
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <PlateController>
      <Toolbar />

      <Plate>
        <PlateContent />
      </Plate>

      <Plate>
        <PlateContent />
      </Plate>
    </PlateController>
  );
};
```

## From the Parent of Plate

The **`editorRef`** prop is an older, alternative way of accessing the **`editor`** outside of **`Plate`**, and works best in cases where the **`editor`** instance must be accessed in the **`Plate`** component's parent. In all other cases, **`PlateController`** is the preferred solution (see above).

The ref can be created with  **`useRef`**, the setter function of **`useState`**, or a custom ref callback. It is populated with the **`editor`** instance when **`Plate`** mounts, and **`null`** when **`Plate`** unmounts. Since the **`editor`** is unavailable during the first render, and may become unavailable if the **`Plate`** component unmounts, you must handle the case where **`editor`** is **`null`**.

```tsx showLineNumbers {2,13}
const App = () => {
  const editorRef = useRef<PlateEditor | null>(null);

  const handleSomeEvent = useCallback(() => {
    const editor = editorRef.current;

    // Handle the case where editor is null
    if (editor) {
      // Do something with editor
    }
  }, []);

  <Plate editorRef={editorRef}>
    <PlateContent />
  </Plate>
);
```

## Temporary Editor Instance

Sometimes, you'll need to access an **`editor`** instance, but not necessarily the same **`editor`** instance that is used by the Plate editor itself. Such cases include serializing a Plate value to HTML (either on the client or on the server) and deserializing HTML to produce an initial value for Plate.

In these cases, you can create a temporary **`editor`** instance using **`createPlateEditor({ plugins })`**. The only requirement is that you pass the same set of plugins to **`createPlateEditor`** as you pass to the Plate editor itself.

See the following example to deserialize a HTML value and use it as the initial value of the Plate editor.

```tsx showLineNumbers {12}
// Alternatively, define the plugins inside the React component using useMemo
const plugins = createPlugins([
  // ...
]);

const Editor = ({ initialHtml }: { initialHtml: string }) => {
  /**
   * Changing the initialValue after render is not supported, so initialHtml
   * is not included in the useMemo deps.
   */
  const initialValue = useMemo(() => {
    const tmpEditor = createPlateEditor({ plugins });
    return deserializeHtml(tmpEditor, {
      element: initialHtml,
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <Plate plugins={plugins} initialValue={initialValue}>
      <PlateContent />
    </Plate>
  );
};
```
