To do most things with Plate, you'll need to access the `editor` instance at one point or another. The way you'll do this depends on the context in which you need to access the `editor`.

## From Inside a Plugin

Most often, when you want to extend the functionality of your editor, you'll create a [custom Plate plugin](/docs/plugin). Luckily, plugins are one of the easiest places to access the `editor` instance.

### Inside Event Handlers

Use the first argument of the handler function.

```ts
const createMyPlugin = createPluginFactory({
  key: KEY_MY_PLUGIN,
  handlers: {
    onKeyDown: (editor) => (event) => {
      // Do something with editor
    },
    onChange: (editor) => (value) => {
      // Do something with editor
    },
  },
});
```

### Using the Then Option

The purpose of the `then` option is to access the `editor` instance in plugin options that normally don't have access to it. Pass a function that takes an `editor` and returns an object to be merged with the top-level plugin options.

For example, suppose you had this code and wanted to access the `editor` instance inside `deserializeHtml`:

```ts
const createMyPlugin = createPluginFactory({
  key: KEY_MY_PLUGIN,
  deserializeHtml: {
    // Need editor here
  },
});
```

You would wrap the `deserializeHtml` option inside `then`.

```ts
const createMyPlugin = createPluginFactory({
  key: KEY_MY_PLUGIN,
  then: (editor) => ({
    deserializeHtml: {
      // Do something with editor
    },
  }),
});
```

## From a Child of Plate

Use the `usePlateEditorState` hook.

This applies to both custom plugin components and direct children of the `Plate`  component itself. More broadly, you can call `usePlateEditorState` from any React component that is rendered as a descendant of the `Plate` (or `PlateProvider`) component.

```tsx
const ParagraphElement = ({
  className,
  children,
  ...props
}: PlateElementProps) => {
  const editor = usePlateEditorState();
  
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    console.log('You clicked on a paragraph, and the editor is ', editor);
  }, [editor]);
  
  return (
    <PlateElement asChild className={className} {...props}>
      <p onClick={handleClick}>
        {children}
      </p>
    </PlateElement>
  );
};
```

One common pattern is to add an effect component as a child of `Plate` that consumes `editor` and returns `null`.

```tsx
const CustomEffect = () => {
  const editor = usePlateEditorState();
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      console.log('The editor is ', editor);
    }, 1000);
    
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, [editor]);
  
  return null;
};

export default () => (
  <Plate>
    <CustomEffect />
  </Plate>
);
```

## From a Sibling of Plate

Wrap `Plate` and the sibling in `PlateProvider`, and then use `usePlateEditorState` from within the sibling.

Note that certain `Plate` props, such as `plugins` and `initialValue`, must be lifted up to the `PlateProvider`. See [From an Ancestor](#from-an-ancestor) if this is impractical or impossible for you to achieve.

```tsx
const Toolbar = () => {
  const editor = usePlateEditorState();
  // Do something with editor
  // ...
};

export default () => (
  <PlateProvider>
    <Toolbar />
    <Plate />
  </PlateProvider>
);
```

## From an Ancestor

If you need to access the `editor` instance from an ancestor of `Plate`, wrapping the relevant components in a `PlateProvider` is the preferred solution. If this is not an option, you can instead use the `editorRef` prop to pass a reference to the `editor` instance up the React component tree to where it is needed.

The `editorRef` prop can be used with `useRef`, `useState`, or a custom ref callback. Regardless of which you use, you'll need to handle the case where `editor` is null because the editor hasn't had a chance to render yet or has unmounted. 

### With a Ref Object

```tsx
const App = () => {
  const editorRef = useRef<PlateEditor | null>(null);
  
  const handleSomeEvent = useCallback(() => {
    // editor has type PlateEditor | null
    const editor = editorRef.current;
    
    if (editor) {
      // Do something with editor
    }
  }, []);
  
  // Pass editorRef and handleSomeEvent down to where they're needed
  // ...
};

const MyEditor = ({
  editorRef,
}: {
  editorRef: MutableRefObject<PlateEditor | null>;
}) => <Plate editorRef={editorRef} />;
```

### With State

If you want your ancestor component to re-render when the editor content changes, you may want to use `useState` to store your `editor` instance.

Note, however, that doing so is not sufficient to cause React to re-render when the editor content changes. This is because `editor` is a mutable object passed and updated by reference. Furthermore, the function passed to `editorRef` is only called when the editor mounts, unmounts or is reset.

In order to re-render the ancestor component when the editor content changes, you'll need to update a state variable inside the `onChange` handler of `Plate`. 

```tsx
const App = () => {
  const [editor, setEditor] = useState<PlateEditor | null>(null);
  const [, handleUpdateEditor] = useReducer((x) => x + 1, 0);
  
  // Pass editor, setEditor and handleUpdateEditor down to where they're needed
  // ...
};

const EditorPreview = ({
  editor,
}: {
  editor: PlateEditor | null;
}) => {
  // html has type string | null
  const html = useMemo(
    () => editor && serializeHtml(editor, {
      nodes: editor.children,
    }),
    [editor, editor?.children]
  );
  
  if (!html) return null;
  return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: html }} />;
};

const MyEditor = ({
  setEditor,
  handleUpdateEditor,
}: {
  setEditor: (editor: PlateEditor | null) => void;
  handleUpdateEditor: () => void;
}) => (
  <Plate
    editorRef={setEditor}
    onChange={handleUpdateEditor}
  />
);
```

<Callout className="my-4">
  **Did you know?**<br />
  This limitation also applies to the `usePlateEditorRef` hook. The `usePlateEditorState` hook (which is a wrapper for `usePlateEditorRef`) works around it in a similar way by forcing React to re-render when the editor content changes.
</Callout>

## Temporary Editor Instance

Sometimes, you'll need to access an `editor` instance, but not necessarily the same `editor` instance that is used by the Plate editor itself. Such cases include serializing a Plate value to HTML (either on the client or on the server) and deserializing HTML to produce an initial value for Plate.

In these cases, you can create a temporary `editor` instance using `createPlateEditor({ plugins })`. The only requirement is that you pass the same set of plugins to `createPlateEditor` as you pass to the Plate editor itself.

See the following example to deserialize a HTML value and use it as the initial value of the Plate editor.

```tsx
// Alternatively, define the plugins inside the React component using useMemo
const plugins = createPlugins([
  // ...
]);

export default ({ initialHtml }: { initialHtml: string }) => {
  /**
   * Changing the initialValue after render is not supported, so initialHtml
   * is not included in the useMemo deps.
   */
  const initialValue = useMemo(() => {
    const tmpEditor = createPlateEditor({ plugins });
    return deserializeHtml(editor, {
      element: initialHtml,
    });
  }, []);
  
  return (
    <Plate
      plugins={plugins}
      initialValue={initialValue}
    />
  );
};
```
