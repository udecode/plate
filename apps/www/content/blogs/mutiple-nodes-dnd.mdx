## Comprehensive Drag-and-Drop Upgrade

> This update adds multi-block drag-and-drop and fixes the issue where dropping was not possible in the margin-top area, greatly enhancing the drag-and-drop experience.

### 1. Multi-block Drag-and-Drop Support

You can select multiple blocks using **two methods**:

- **Method 1: Using block-selection**  
  Use the block-selection feature to select multiple blocks and drag them together:

- **Method 2: Using the editor's native selection**  
  Directly use the editor's native selection to select multiple blocks and drag them all at once:

### 2. Fixed the Issue with Dropping in margin-top Areas

Previously, when there was a `margin-top` above the target block, users could not drop in that area, which affected the smoothness of the drag-and-drop experience:

In the new version, this issue has **been fixed**. Now, the drop area correctly recognizes margins, allowing users to drag and insert blocks smoothly in the margin-top area for a more natural experience:

## Looking Ahead

This update makes the overall drag-and-drop experience smoother and more natural. However, to achieve truly "freeform" drag-and-drop, further improvements are needed:

- Support dropping outside the editor
- Optimize the position of the drop line when hovering over table borders
