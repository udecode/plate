# Creating Skills & Commands

This skill teaches how to create effective Claude Code skills following the official specification from [code.claude.com/docs/en/skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills).

## Commands and Skills Are Now The Same Thing

Custom slash commands have been merged into skills. A file at `.claude/commands/review.md` and a skill at `.claude/skills/review/SKILL.md` both create `/review` and work the same way. Existing `.claude/commands/` files keep working. Skills add optional features: a directory for supporting files, frontmatter to control invocation, and automatic context loading.

**If a skill and a command share the same name, the skill takes precedence.**

## When To Create What

**Use a command file** (`commands/name.md`) when:
- Simple, single-file workflow
- No supporting files needed
- Task-oriented action (deploy, commit, triage)

**Use a skill directory** (`skills/name/SKILL.md`) when:
- Need supporting reference files, scripts, or templates
- Background knowledge Claude should auto-load
- Complex enough to benefit from progressive disclosure

Both use identical YAML frontmatter and markdown content format.

## Standard Markdown Format

Use YAML frontmatter + markdown body with **standard markdown headings**. Keep it clean and direct.

```markdown
---
name: my-skill-name
description: What it does and when to use it
---

# My Skill Name

## Frontmatter Reference

All fields are optional. Only `description` is recommended.

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | No | Display name. Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens (max 64 chars). Defaults to directory name. |
| `description` | Recommended | What it does AND when to use it. Claude uses this for auto-discovery. Max 1024 chars. |
| `argument-hint` | No | Hint shown during autocomplete. Example: `[issue-number]` |
| `disable-model-invocation` | No | Set `true` to prevent Claude auto-loading. Use for manual workflows like `/deploy`, `/commit`. Default: `false`. |
| `user-invocable` | No | Set `false` to hide from `/` menu. Use for background knowledge. Default: `true`. |
| `allowed-tools` | No | Tools Claude can use without permission prompts. Example: `Read, Bash(git *)` |
| `model` | No | Model to use. Options: `haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus`. |
| `context` | No | Set `fork` to run in isolated subagent context. |
| `agent` | No | Subagent type when `context: fork`. Options: `Explore`, `Plan`, `general-purpose`, or custom agent name. |

### Invocation Control

| Frontmatter | User can invoke | Claude can invoke | When loaded |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| (default) | Yes | Yes | Description always in context, full content loads when invoked |
| `disable-model-invocation: true` | Yes | No | Description not in context, loads only when user invokes |
| `user-invocable: false` | No | Yes | Description always in context, loads when relevant |

**Use `disable-model-invocation: true`** for workflows with side effects: `/deploy`, `/commit`, `/triage-prs`, `/send-slack-message`. You don't want Claude deciding to deploy because your code looks ready.

**Use `user-invocable: false`** for background knowledge that isn't a meaningful user action: coding conventions, domain context, legacy system docs.

## Dynamic Features

### Arguments

Use `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder for user input. If not present in content, arguments are appended automatically.

```yaml
---
name: fix-issue
description: Fix a GitHub issue
disable-model-invocation: true
---

Fix GitHub issue $ARGUMENTS following our coding standards.
```

Access individual args: `$ARGUMENTS[0]` or shorthand `$0`, `$1`, `$2`.

### Dynamic Context Injection

The `` !`command` `` syntax runs shell commands before content is sent to Claude:

```yaml
---
name: pr-summary
description: Summarize changes in a pull request
context: fork
agent: Explore
---

## Context
- PR diff: !`gh pr diff`
- Changed files: !`gh pr diff --name-only`

Summarize this pull request...
```

### Running in a Subagent

Add `context: fork` to run in isolation. The skill content becomes the subagent's prompt. It won't have conversation history.

```yaml
---
name: deep-research
description: Research a topic thoroughly
context: fork
agent: Explore
---

Research $ARGUMENTS thoroughly:
1. Find relevant files
2. Analyze the code
3. Summarize findings
```

## Progressive Disclosure

Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines. Split detailed content into reference files:

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md           # Entry point (required, overview + navigation)
├── reference.md       # Detailed docs (loaded when needed)
├── examples.md        # Usage examples (loaded when needed)
└── scripts/
    └── helper.py      # Utility script (executed, not loaded)
```

Link from SKILL.md: `For API details, see [reference.md](reference.md).`

Keep references **one level deep** from SKILL.md. Avoid nested chains.

## Effective Descriptions

The description enables skill discovery. Include both **what** it does and **when** to use it.

**Good:**
```yaml
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.
```

**Bad:**
```yaml
description: Helps with documents
```

## What Would You Like To Do?

1. **Create new skill** - Build from scratch
2. **Create new command** - Build a slash command
3. **Audit existing skill** - Check against best practices
4. **Add component** - Add workflow/reference/example
5. **Get guidance** - Understand skill design

## Creating a New Skill or Command

### Step 1: Choose Type

Ask: Is this a manual workflow (deploy, commit, triage) or background knowledge (conventions, patterns)?

- **Manual workflow** → command with `disable-model-invocation: true`
- **Background knowledge** → skill without `disable-model-invocation`
- **Complex with supporting files** → skill directory

### Step 2: Create the File

**Command:**
```markdown
---
name: my-command
description: What this command does
argument-hint: [expected arguments]
disable-model-invocation: true
allowed-tools: Bash(gh *), Read
---

# Command Title

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Context
...

### Step 2: Execute
...

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Expected outcome 1
- [ ] Expected outcome 2
```

**Skill:**
```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What it does. Use when [trigger conditions].
---

# Skill Title

## Quick Start
[Immediate actionable example]

## Instructions
[Core guidance]

## Examples
[Concrete input/output pairs]
```

### Step 3: Add Reference Files (If Needed)

Link from SKILL.md to detailed content:
```markdown
For API reference, see [reference.md](reference.md).
For form filling guide, see [forms.md](forms.md).
```

### Step 4: Test With Real Usage

1. Test with actual tasks, not test scenarios
2. Invoke directly with `/skill-name` to verify
3. Check auto-triggering by asking something that matches the description
4. Refine based on real behavior

## Audit Checklist

- [ ] Valid YAML frontmatter (name + description)
- [ ] Description includes trigger keywords and is specific
- [ ] Uses standard markdown headings (not XML tags)
- [ ] SKILL.md under 500 lines
- [ ] `disable-model-invocation: true` if it has side effects
- [ ] `allowed-tools` set if specific tools needed
- [ ] References one level deep, properly linked
- [ ] Examples are concrete, not abstract
- [ ] Tested with real usage

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **XML tags in body** - Use standard markdown headings
- **Vague descriptions** - Be specific with trigger keywords
- **Deep nesting** - Keep references one level from SKILL.md
- **Missing invocation control** - Side-effect workflows need `disable-model-invocation: true`
- **Too many options** - Provide a default with escape hatch
- **Punting to Claude** - Scripts should handle errors explicitly
