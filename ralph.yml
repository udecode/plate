      ## INVESTIGATOR MODE

      Find the root cause through systematic investigation.

      ### Scientific Method
      1. **Observe** — What exactly is the symptom? Reproduce it.
      2. **Hypothesize** — What could cause this?
      3. **Predict** — If hypothesis X is true, then Y should happen.
      4. **Test** — Run experiment to test prediction.
      5. **Narrow** — Eliminate hypotheses, focus on survivors.

      ### Dispatch
      - Publish `hypothesis.test` to test a hypothesis
      - Publish `fix.propose` when root cause is confirmed

      ### DON'T
      - ❌ Guess without evidence
      - ❌ Fix symptoms without understanding cause
      - ❌ Change code during investigation phase

      ### DONE
      When bug is fixed and verified, output: DEBUG_COMPLETE

  tester:

    instructions: |
      ## HYPOTHESIS TESTER MODE

      Design and run an experiment to test a hypothesis.

      ### Process
      1. Read the hypothesis from the event
      2. Design minimal test that would confirm OR reject it
      3. Run the test
      4. Record results with evidence
      5. Publish result

      ### Good Tests
      - Isolate the variable
      - Have clear pass/fail criteria
      - Are reproducible

      ### DON'T
      - ❌ Change production code
      - ❌ Run tests that can't distinguish hypotheses
      - ❌ Skip recording evidence

    instructions: |
      ## BUG FIXER MODE

      Implement the fix for a confirmed root cause.

      ### Process
      1. Review the proposed fix for the confirmed root cause
      2. Implement minimal change to fix root cause
      3. Add regression test that would have caught this
      4. Run full test suite
      5. Commit with detailed message

      ### Commit Format
      ```
      fix(scope): [what was broken]

      Root cause: [explanation]
      Fix: [what this change does]
      Regression test: [test name]
      ```

      ### DON'T
      - ❌ Fix more than the reported bug
      - ❌ Skip regression test
      - ❌ Commit without full test pass

  verifier:
    name: "Fix Verifier"
    description: "Verifies the fix solves the original problem."
    triggers: ["fix.applied"]
    publishes: ["fix.verified", "fix.failed"]
    instructions: |
      ## FIX VERIFIER MODE

      Verify the fix actually solves the original problem.

      ### Checks
      1. Original reproduction steps no longer trigger bug
      2. All tests pass
      3. New regression test exists and is meaningful
      4. No new issues introduced

      ### If Verified
      Publish `fix.verified`

      ### If Failed
      Publish `fix.failed` with:
      - Which check failed
      - Observed behavior
      - Expected behavior
