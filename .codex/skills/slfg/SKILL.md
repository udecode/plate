Swarm-enabled LFG. Run these steps in order, parallelizing where indicated. Do not stop between steps — complete every step through to the end.

## Sequential Phase

1. **Optional:** If the `ralph-wiggum` skill is available, run `/ralph-wiggum:ralph-loop "finish all slash commands" --completion-promise "DONE"`. If not available or it fails, skip and continue to step 2 immediately.
2. `/workflows:plan $ARGUMENTS`
3. `/compound-engineering:deepen-plan`
4. `/workflows:work` — **Use swarm mode**: Make a Task list and launch an army of agent swarm subagents to build the plan

## Parallel Phase

After work completes, launch steps 5 and 6 as **parallel swarm agents** (both only need code to be written):

5. `/workflows:review` — spawn as background Task agent
6. `/compound-engineering:test-browser` — spawn as background Task agent

Wait for both to complete before continuing.

## Finalize Phase

7. `/compound-engineering:resolve_todo_parallel` — resolve any findings from the review
8. `/compound-engineering:feature-video` — record the final walkthrough and add to PR
9. Output `<promise>DONE</promise>` when video is in PR

Start with step 1 now.
