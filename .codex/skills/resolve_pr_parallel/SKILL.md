Resolve all PR comments using parallel processing.

Claude Code automatically detects and understands your git context:

- Current branch detection
- Associated PR context
- All PR comments and review threads
- Can work with any PR by specifying the PR number, or ask it.

## Workflow

### 1. Analyze

Get all unresolved comments for PR

```bash
gh pr status
bin/get-pr-comments PR_NUMBER
```

### 2. Plan

Create a TodoWrite list of all unresolved items grouped by type.

### 3. Implement (PARALLEL)

Spawn a pr-comment-resolver agent for each unresolved item in parallel.

So if there are 3 comments, it will spawn 3 pr-comment-resolver agents in parallel. liek this

1. Task pr-comment-resolver(comment1)
2. Task pr-comment-resolver(comment2)
3. Task pr-comment-resolver(comment3)

Always run all in parallel subagents/Tasks for each Todo item.

### 4. Commit & Resolve

- Commit changes
- Run bin/resolve-pr-thread THREAD_ID_1
- Push to remote

Last, check bin/get-pr-comments PR_NUMBER again to see if all comments are resolved. They should be, if not, repeat the process from 1.
