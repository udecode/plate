Git Worktree Manager

Usage: worktree-manager.sh <command> [options]

Commands:
  create <branch-name> [from-branch]  Create new worktree (copies .env files automatically)
                                      (from-branch defaults to main)
  list | ls                           List all worktrees
  switch | go [name]                  Switch to worktree
  copy-env | env [name]               Copy .env files from main repo to worktree
                                      (if name omitted, uses current worktree)
  cleanup | clean                     Clean up inactive worktrees
  help                                Show this help message

Environment Files:
  - Automatically copies .env, .env.local, .env.test, etc. on create
  - Skips .env.example (should be in git)
  - Creates .backup files if destination already exists
  - Use 'copy-env' to refresh env files after main repo changes

Examples:
  worktree-manager.sh create feature-login
  worktree-manager.sh create feature-auth develop
  worktree-manager.sh switch feature-login
  worktree-manager.sh copy-env feature-login
  worktree-manager.sh copy-env                   # copies to current worktree
  worktree-manager.sh cleanup
  worktree-manager.sh list
